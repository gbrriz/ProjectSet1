With somebody else's girl, yeah

But my imagination was running wild
Ooh

Deep in a sense of denial
But then you rescued me baby
Opened my eyes and made me see you babe
What real love can be

You're the angel that I need

Don't be sold a dream

Don't be led to believe this one's for you 
Calculate your needs

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in, oh no
Once you've tasted love 

Still too early to know
Give them time and they will grow 
Don't believe that the first's the one for you 
Most will grow to be tall
Others will break and fall 
Keep your eye on the strongest head of them all 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world

For thirty days you're on your back 
Doing not a single dance

Ooh, ooh
Oh yeah
Put your head against my life 
What do you hear 
A million words just trying to make 
The love song of the year 
Close your eyes but don't forget 
What you have heard 
A man who's trying to say three words 
The words that make me scared 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
And here I am 
Here I am
A million love songs later
Here I am

Looking to the future now 
This is what I see 
A million chances pass me by 
A million chances to hold you 
Take me back, take me back 
To where I used to be 
To hide away from all my truth 
Through the light I see 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
Here I am
Just for you girl
A million love songs later
Here I am
I feel for you, babe
Feel for you baby
A million love songs later
Here I, here I amBaby I'm watching you to see 
I don't like the way you've been treating me 
I promised you nothing and gave you much more 
Making love is all you wanted me for 

You're never satisfied, you're never satisfied 
If you open your mind you'll see 
That you could be satisfied with me 

Baby you criticize my every move 
Look, can't you see I've nothing to prove 
I've had enough, it's a matter of time 
Maybe we'll make it somewhere down the line 

You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 

I often wonder what I see in you 
You don't do the things that I want you to do 
I open my eyes and dream it's alright 
Maybe we'll make it together tonight
I'm tired of closing my eyes, to picture you in my mind 
It feels so cold to be alone 
Not sure where I want to be, so close to finding my dream 
We need to hold on to all the times we spoke of love 
Now I pray to God above that someday I can find the door 
I'm looking for 

I can make it, I know I can 
I can save this love forever 
I can make I know I can 
We can make this work together 

It's not a lonely men's dream,it's just that now that there's been 
A taste of love in my life 
That I refuse to return, I've got so much to learn 
How can it feels as though I've reached the top of this steep hill 
For a moment I was standing still 
Now I have the faith I've needed to believe 

'Cause you knop what this love means to me 
You know how it feels when I can see it in your face 
That you're missing me now, you feel I've let you down 
You've gotta hold on, you've gota reach out and believe 

I can make this world a place for me and you 
We can make it, we can make it together 
Do what you like, do what you like
Sugar sweet, if only they all knew 
Jam, can't spread no more you've took my bread

How you've led me on 
And judging by the things you say 
There's gotta be something wrong 
 
What you telling me that for you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
I wanna know 

Seems that I've been playing your game 
And how you think you've won 
But when you count up what you've gained you're the lonely one 

What you telling me that for when you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me

The longer I stayed away for, hidin' from a word
I need to hear now, don't think I'll hear it again (Don't think I'll hear it again)

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (Woah)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Oh yeah)
All I do each night is think (Oh yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within (Closed the door)

If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

But the nights were always warm with you (My love)
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (All I do each night is pray)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Down on my knees)
All I do each night is think (Yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight (Woah)
Of the dream we long to live (We long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times

Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)You've maybe seen me walk behind you 
I follow you just everywhere you go 
I've heard a whisper, they're telling me you've missed her 
I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

Even now I know it doesn't change me 
Maybe someday you'll be free again 
Till then remember, babe I won't surrender 
Still hurts me when I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

You said you've been missing me 
But how can that be girl, how can that be girl 
Now all our plans that used to be passing us by 
You say I want to be freeHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah

Don't you want me to go 
So honey, why don't you beg me to stay 
For love, and talk the way we used to talk 
'Til we both know what we've lost 
Never say the words we did before 
When it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No no, love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away
To a town called yesterday 
Love (love) ain't here anymore 

Listen, oh listen, I don't wanna let go 
So maybe we can change the way we feel 
For love, and open up the way we did before 
Now is the right time 
And I'm sure you'd never say the words you did before
Well, it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No, no love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away, to a town called yesterday 
Love (love) don't live here anymore (ooh no no no)

And when I find a place for me to keep my sweet love (keep my sweet love)
Then I will leave it there forever more, yeah 
And when I find someone to share I'll never give up 
I will hold you and believe that this life leads to more 

Oh, love 
No no no
No no no, well it was over
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore

Love ain't here anymore (don't you beg me to stay, no no no)
Love ain't here anymoreYou came to me, baby 
And I though that I saw love in your eyes 
But all the promises you made were not to be 
I should have seen through your disguise 

Oh no baby you know you always tried 
Make me look the fool, what's goin' on 
You used to be so good to me now what is wrong 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

What has happened to you lately 
I don't sense that lovin', feelin' anymore 
Every time you bring me down I want to cry 
Do you want to see me walkin' out that door 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Oh no baby you know you're always trying 
To make me look the fool 
Won't you tell me why you hurt me

No baby, I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for meI'm mad at you, because af all the things you do 
I want you to see the way your games are hurting me 
So why did I ever fall in love with you 
You're all of my nightmares and dreams come true 

What can I do to make you talk this problem through 
You said you've nothing to hide 
So let me hear your feelings inside 
I never dreamed that I'd see this kind of thing in my life 
So baby, please let me go, let me go 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

All I can see are staring eyes of mystery 
I've tried to look behind before you take my dignity and pride 
We sit and talk all night, still you never seem to lose your height 
You believe in yourself, I hope I'm never gonna need your help 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

You don't want me, you don't need me, I got news now 
'cause baby I'm watching you 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours tooDeceit and lies, is all I've taken 
Let me surface to breath 
No sacrifice, no inspiration 
Can you understand me? 

Why should I ask you, 
Why should I worry? 
You never worry about me 
Why should I ned you, 
Why don't I let you go? 
And let my heartaches run free 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 

What's on my mind, so many questions 
Though the answers I can guess 
You slip away shelter from confrontation 
Look my life is such a mess 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 
You hurt my mind, you hurt my soul 
Never believing what I'm saying 
I'll hunt you down, I'll make you mine 
You'll be the game I've started playing 
And if you won't be there I will know where you're going 
And if you won't be there I will try everyway of showing you that 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I need 

You understand, you realize 
The scene that I'm creating 
And all the while you compromise 
On the liberties I'm taking 
If you don't believe I want just you and I together 
Then you won't believe the dream of you and I forever because 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I needI am just one man with his one pair of eyes 
I dress in normal clothes and I don't try to disguise 
I'm looking out for love however it may seem 
I never do return in the always winning team 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heart 

I had my spills and thrills of love 
And held it in my hand 
I held on tight until it broke 
And I crashed to the ground 
Love cannot be on my side 
It's clearer every dull 
That every time I reach for love 
It always runs away 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heartIt's good to be near you, even though I'm alone 
Reviving memories of our happy home 
No sign of sunlight since you ran away 
These rooms get darker now every day 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

The consequences of freedom 
But now you have what you dreamed 
Just understand that things are not as they seem 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

I don't want to be lonely 
Because you're not there for me to be 
I don't want to be lonely 
I want to be loved 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me?I come to your door to see you again,
But where you once stood was an old man instead
I asked where you'd be, he said she's moved, on you see
All I have is a number you'd better ask her not me
So I picked up the phone and dialed your number
Not sure to put it down or speak
Then a voice I once knew answered in a sweet voice
She said hello then paused before I began to speak

Babe I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

You held your voice well, there were tears I could tell
But where were you now, was you gonna tell me in time?
Just give me a town and I'll be straight down
I've got so much to tell you about where I have been
As I walk down your road, can't wait to be near you
I can't keep the feeling in inside (I, I, I can't keep it inside)
As I stand at your door you answered in a sweet voice
You said hello then pause before I begin to speak

Babe (Babe), I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

As I looked away, I saw a face behind you
A little boy stood at your door
And as I looked again I saw his face was shining
He had my eyes (My eyes), he had my smile (my smile)

Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), please take me back (I'm back again)
Take me back (Babe)
Back here again
Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
Can't you see that I'm back again (Babe)
I'm here for you (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), just me and you (I'm back again)
You and me (Babe)
OohSure, so sure
Sure, so sure
Feel it, move it, feel it, move back
Need you so much, yeah, yeah
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

Sitting here runnin' to my lover (lover)
Last time we met, I wasn't to sure (not so sure)
Now I'm hoping, maybe dreaming, for a life as one
When she reads this I'm hoping she'll call (call me baby)
I need more much, more than before
I need positive reactions, whenever I'm down

'Cause I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking on my door
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

It's not a game, so don't play hard to get
Tired of running after you
There's no connections holding us down (down)
Isn't it a shame (shame), that it never happened (isn't it a shame), oh yeah
Though still here we are the second time round
It's gonna be social, compatible, sexual, irresistible
It's gotta be right for life

Now I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking at my door
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside, yeah
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found, yeah, yeah

Holdin', squeezin', touchin', teasin'
Wantin', wishin', waitin', thinkin'
Of your love, yeah yeah
Blindin', groovin', feel it, move it

I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good

It's our Sunday through our Saturday love 
This ain't no weekend thing this ain't no teenage game 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

I have no reason to be feeling kind of strange 
But I guess that's just the man that I am 
In the clouds, in my dreams in pouring rain 
Hand in hand, under this rainbow we can always still the same 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday loveMaking my way through photographs 
Of the night when you first stood by my side 
Old friends with smiles some are here some are gone 
Good memories of our senior high 
Looking back we're the only couple still together 
Even then I knew this love would be forever, I knew 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

Our lives have all changed we've come a long long way 
Our faces show the lines of two young songs 
And in their houses there will be pictures 
Like the ones of you and me 
Hope they can look back and smile just like we have done 
Never once have I felt the need for another 
We were strong and survived the storm in time to discover 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

All of the smiles we have won 
Just from looking back and reliving all the good times 
And when we've been through all the pages 
We just start again, oh 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you
We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
Tudutu
We've had success (tudutu), we've had good times (tudutu)
But remember this (tudutu)

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there

With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realized what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I look so high you don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of "I can't explain this feeling" now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I made
The fact of reality (oh)

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for more
But remember this

We're not invincible, we're not invincible, no
We're only people, we're only people
Hey we're not invincible, we're not invincible
So again I tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, never forget where
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream (woah)
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing, oh baby
Never, no never, never forget for love
Someday, louder, louder, louder, louder loud

Oh (woah)
Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, louder now
Someday, come on, come on, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody (woah)Can we talk, thoughout the night I need you so bad 
And when we talk can you understand my feelings 
And understand it hurts to be without you 

Never prepared, never know what's going wrong 
I'm loosing though, I always thought this love was so strong 
So alone, so lost in the dark, 
So hurt, cause you will always have a place in my heart 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love, I need it 

Let's take a walk and reminisce about 
The feelings we used to feel 
Just stay the word and I'll be back for good my baby 
I'll be back to give you girl what you deserve 

Don't say too much, did I try to rule your life 
Did the love we had between us 
Miss the road to paradise 
Can we try again, can we chance it one more time 
Can the ecstasy we found here 
Be re-claimed as yours and mine 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your loveI kind of keep asking myself little questions 
Like where do I go from here 
I seem to keep loosing track of time and how long it's been 
Since I last had you near 

Been a painful road to a door that's closed 
Been a gamble that I knew I couldn't win 
Been a lonely conversation to this photograph of you 
In the mirror there's a sing I must give in 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you 

I used to enjoy spending my time on my own here 
Watching the jaded people pass 
Now here I am sharing their pain and their lonely tears 
And walking a road of broken glass 

It's a constant fight to get through each day and night 
It's a war between the present and the past 
And the face that's in your mind every time you close your eyes 
What's the reason, what's the answer, how long will this last 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 

Been a long time since I heard your last goobdye 
Still I hear it clearly every day and night 
What's the point in love when you have to give it up 
Yet still you need it and it's nowhere you can find 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you   
Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

This is the time I feel it 
Here in the middle of the night 
Still wide awake and feeling cheated 
From a girl I thought was treating me right 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

Gotta get away from the feelings I had 
Be real you won't be seeing her again 
It's complicated when you're feeling so bad 
And your girl is still walking away 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true Only one way to describe, this is deceit I am hiding 
Never been here before, never wanna see here again 
I've strayed from a long term lover 
And found greater lust from another 
My conscience is keeping me awake and shouting at me all night 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Being loved is a big responsibility, 
You can never give too much back 
You know it's so easy to walk away and leave that lady flat 
My life's feeling crowded with possessions, am I lucky or sad 
Is it time to turn away and lose everything I had 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Moving in circles, decisions chasing me round and round 
Why's life never easy, or do we make it hard for ourselves 
And when we find love we need to look for something new 
'Cos when it's all over, you always feel the need to be loved 
Like she always loved you 
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah, woah, yeah

I thought I found love
With somebody else's girl, yeah
Ooh

Walkin 'round feeling so broken-hearted
Lost in a different world
Then you came in my life
Bought me back to reality someday
Now I don't need a fantasy
You're the only one I need

I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
Ooh

I will never, no I'll never
I will never lose my way again
Ooh yeah

I thought you'd soon be my girl
But my imagination was running wild
Ooh
I wouldn't listen to a single soul
Deep in a sense of denial
But then you rescued me baby
Opened my eyes and made me see you babe
What real love can be

You're the angel that I need

I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
Ooh

I will never, no I'll never
I will never lose my way again
Oh sweet baby
Ooh

Oh, I see heaven in your eyes with me
Yeah, yeah
Oh baby
Now I will give my lovin' faithfully

Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah sweet baby
Be my angel

Heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love

Sweet sweet baby
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love

Heaven sweet sweet baby
On the wings of love
You gave me heaven
Sweet heaven baby, sweet babyLove, once you've tasted love
Love, once you've tasted love
Love, once you've tasted love
Love, once you've tasted love

Don't be sold a dream
Remember how the past has been 
Don't be led to believe this one's for you 
Calculate your needs
I see there's room to plant your seeds 
Don't decide |til you see how the others have grown 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in, oh no
Once you've tasted love 

Still too early to know
Give them time and they will grow 
Don't believe that the first's the one for you 
Most will grow to be tall
Others will break and fall 
Keep your eye on the strongest head of them all 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning 
Your head is spinning 
Once you've tasted love 

Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in, oh no
Can't control your mind and your head is still spinning, oh yeah
(Once you've tasted love) once you've tasted love is just the beginning 
Once you've tasted love 

You've tasted love, you know it's good 
Come taste my love 
You know you should 

Came into my world and the badness disappears
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I'm gonna work off all your fears 
It feels so nice to be with you
Us two, we fit like a glove 
When I see your eyes I realize you too have tasted love 

You've tasted love, you know it's good

For thirty days you're on your back 
Doing not a single dance

Put your head against my life 
What do you hear 
A million words just trying to make 
The love song of the year 
Close your eyes but don't forget 
What you have heard 
A man who's trying to say three words 
The words that make me scared 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
And here I am 
Here I am
A million love songs later
Here I am

Looking to the future now 
This is what I see 
A million chances pass me by 
A million chances to hold you 
Take me back, take me back 
To where I used to be 
To hide away from all my truth 
Through the light I see 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
Here I am
Just for you girl
A million love songs later
Here I am
I feel for you, babe
Feel for you baby
A million love songs later
Here I, here I amBaby I'm watching you to see 
I don't like the way you've been treating me 
I promised you nothing and gave you much more 
Making love is all you wanted me for 

You're never satisfied, you're never satisfied 
If you open your mind you'll see 
That you could be satisfied with me 

Baby you criticize my every move 
Look, can't you see I've nothing to prove 
I've had enough, it's a matter of time 
Maybe we'll make it somewhere down the line 

You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 

I often wonder what I see in you 
You don't do the things that I want you to do 
I open my eyes and dream it's alright 
Maybe we'll make it together tonight
I'm tired of closing my eyes, to picture you in my mind 
It feels so cold to be alone 
Not sure where I want to be, so close to finding my dream 
We need to hold on to all the times we spoke of love 
Now I pray to God above that someday I can find the door 
I'm looking for 

I can make it, I know I can 
I can save this love forever 
I can make I know I can 
We can make this work together 

It's not a lonely men's dream,it's just that now that there's been 
A taste of love in my life 
That I refuse to return, I've got so much to learn 
How can it feels as though I've reached the top of this steep hill 
For a moment I was standing still 
Now I have the faith I've needed to believe 

'Cause you knop what this love means to me 
You know how it feels when I can see it in your face 
That you're missing me now, you feel I've let you down 
You've gotta hold on, you've gota reach out and believe 

I can make this world a place for me and you 
We can make it, we can make it together 
Do what you like, do what you like
Sugar sweet, if only they all knew 
Jam, can't spread no more you've took my bread

No need to tell me, do what you want

Do what you likeStanding back I can't believe
How you've led me on 
And judging by the things you say 
There's gotta be something wrong 
 
What you telling me that for you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
I wanna know 

Seems that I've been playing your game 
And how you think you've won 
But when you count up what you've gained you're the lonely one 

What you telling me that for when you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me

Your promises have never been anything you made them seem

We've said goodbye, the taxi cab is waiting
Now don't you cry, just one more kiss
Before I have to go
Hey girl I know the situation changed
And so much is new but something in my life
Remains the same 'cause

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

The rumors true, you know that there've been others
What can I do, I tell you baby they don't mean a thing
Now girl don't go and throw our love away (throw our love away)
I'll be home soon back in your arms to hear you say that

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But I still love you
(Everything changes but you)
I'll spend every single day
Thinking about you

Though everything changes around us
(Baby don't you cry)
We will be the same as before forever more

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

(Everything changes but you)
I'll be thinking about you
Thinking about you
(Everything changes but you)
'Cause you know I love you
Know that I love you

(Everything changes but you)
I'll be thinking about you
Thinking about you
(Everything changes but you)
I love you
I love youWhen the time grew near, for me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for, hidin' from a word
I need to hear now, don't think I'll hear it again (Don't think I'll hear it again)

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (Woah)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Oh yeah)
All I do each night is think (Oh yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within (Closed the door)

If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

But the nights were always warm with you (My love)
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (All I do each night is pray)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Down on my knees)
All I do each night is think (Yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight (Woah)
Of the dream we long to live (We long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

All I do each night is pray (Come on, time is running out)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (You and me)
All I do each night is think, of all the times (On my knees, you and me)
I've closed the door to keep my love within (On my knees)
All I do each night is pray (You and me, forever more)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)You've maybe seen me walk behind you 
I follow you just everywhere you go 
I've heard a whisper, they're telling me you've missed her 
I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

Even now I know it doesn't change me 
Maybe someday you'll be free again 
Till then remember, babe I won't surrender 
Still hurts me when I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

You said you've been missing me 
But how can that be girl, how can that be girl 
Now all our plans that used to be passing us by 
You say I want to be freeHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (come on, yeah), your love is my only desire (I need your love)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need, I need your love

Yeah, you got to be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah)
Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah
Strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side (on the other side)
And I got hope (hope) in my soul, I'll keep walkin' baby
Keep on walkin' baby

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire (only desire)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire, 'cause I need your loveOh yeah
Baby 
Don't you want me to go 
So honey, why don't you beg me to stay 
For love, and talk the way we used to talk 
'Til we both know what we've lost 
Never say the words we did before 
When it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No no, love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away
To a town called yesterday 
Love (love) ain't here anymore 

Listen, oh listen, I don't wanna let go 
So maybe we can change the way we feel 
For love, and open up the way we did before 
Now is the right time 
And I'm sure you'd never say the words you did before
Well, it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No, no love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away, to a town called yesterday 
Love (love) don't live here anymore (ooh no no no)

And when I find a place for me to keep my sweet love (keep my sweet love)
Then I will leave it there forever more, yeah 
And when I find someone to share I'll never give up 
I will hold you and believe that this life leads to more 

Oh, love 
No no no
No no no, well it was over
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore (it's gone away, it's gone away, to a town called yesterday)
Love ain't here anymore (don't you beg me to stay, no no no)
Love ain't here anymoreYou came to me, baby 
And I though that I saw love in your eyes 
But all the promises you made were not to be 
I should have seen through your disguise 

Oh no baby you know you always tried 
Make me look the fool, what's goin' on 
You used to be so good to me now what is wrong 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

What has happened to you lately 
I don't sense that lovin', feelin' anymore 
Every time you bring me down I want to cry 
Do you want to see me walkin' out that door 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Oh no baby you know you're always trying 
To make me look the fool 
Won't you tell me why you hurt me 
Is this the love has got to be 
No baby, I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for meI'm mad at you, because af all the things you do 
I want you to see the way your games are hurting me 
So why did I ever fall in love with you 
You're all of my nightmares and dreams come true 

What can I do to make you talk this problem through 
You said you've nothing to hide 
So let me hear your feelings inside 
I never dreamed that I'd see this kind of thing in my life 
So baby, please let me go, let me go 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

All I can see are staring eyes of mystery 
I've tried to look behind before you take my dignity and pride 
We sit and talk all night, still you never seem to lose your height 
You believe in yourself, I hope I'm never gonna need your help 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

You don't want me, you don't need me, I got news now 
'cause baby I'm watching you 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours tooDeceit and lies, is all I've taken 
Let me surface to breath 
No sacrifice, no inspiration 
Can you understand me? 

Why should I ask you, 
Why should I worry? 
You never worry about me 
Why should I ned you, 
Why don't I let you go? 
And let my heartaches run free 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 

What's on my mind, so many questions 
Though the answers I can guess 
You slip away shelter from confrontation 
Look my life is such a mess 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 
You hurt my mind, you hurt my soul 
Never believing what I'm saying 
I'll hunt you down, I'll make you mine 
You'll be the game I've started playing 
And if you won't be there I will know where you're going 
And if you won't be there I will try everyway of showing you that 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I need 

You understand, you realize 
The scene that I'm creating 
And all the while you compromise 
On the liberties I'm taking 
If you don't believe I want just you and I together 
Then you won't believe the dream of you and I forever because 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I needI am just one man with his one pair of eyes 
I dress in normal clothes and I don't try to disguise 
I'm looking out for love however it may seem 
I never do return in the always winning team 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heart 

I had my spills and thrills of love 
And held it in my hand 
I held on tight until it broke 
And I crashed to the ground 
Love cannot be on my side 
It's clearer every dull 
That every time I reach for love 
It always runs away 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heartIt's good to be near you, even though I'm alone 
Reviving memories of our happy home 
No sign of sunlight since you ran away 
These rooms get darker now every day 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

The consequences of freedom 
But now you have what you dreamed 
Just understand that things are not as they seem 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

I don't want to be lonely 
Because you're not there for me to be 
I don't want to be lonely 
I want to be loved 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me?I come to your door to see you again,
But where you once stood was an old man instead
I asked where you'd be, he said she's moved, on you see
All I have is a number you'd better ask her not me
So I picked up the phone and dialed your number
Not sure to put it down or speak
Then a voice I once knew answered in a sweet voice
She said hello then paused before I began to speak

Babe I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

You held your voice well, there were tears I could tell
But where were you now, was you gonna tell me in time?
Just give me a town and I'll be straight down
I've got so much to tell you about where I have been
As I walk down your road, can't wait to be near you
I can't keep the feeling in inside (I, I, I can't keep it inside)
As I stand at your door you answered in a sweet voice
You said hello then pause before I begin to speak

Babe (Babe), I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

As I looked away, I saw a face behind you
A little boy stood at your door
And as I looked again I saw his face was shining
He had my eyes (My eyes), he had my smile (my smile)

Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), please take me back (I'm back again)
Take me back (Babe)
Back here again
Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
Can't you see that I'm back again (Babe)
I'm here for you (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), just me and you (I'm back again)
You and me (Babe)
OohSure, so sure
Sure, so sure
Feel it, move it, feel it, move back
Need you so much, yeah, yeah
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

Sitting here runnin' to my lover (lover)
Last time we met, I wasn't to sure (not so sure)
Now I'm hoping, maybe dreaming, for a life as one
When she reads this I'm hoping she'll call (call me baby)
I need more much, more than before
I need positive reactions, whenever I'm down

'Cause I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking on my door
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

It's not a game, so don't play hard to get
Tired of running after you
There's no connections holding us down (down)

Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good

Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong (whenever I'm wrong)
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood

It's our Sunday through our Saturday love 
This ain't no weekend thing this ain't no teenage game 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

I have no reason to be feeling kind of strange 
But I guess that's just the man that I am 
In the clouds, in my dreams in pouring rain 
Hand in hand, under this rainbow we can always still the same 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday loveMaking my way through photographs 
Of the night when you first stood by my side 
Old friends with smiles some are here some are gone 
Good memories of our senior high 
Looking back we're the only couple still together 
Even then I knew this love would be forever, I knew 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

Our lives have all changed we've come a long long way 
Our faces show the lines of two young songs 
And in their houses there will be pictures 
Like the ones of you and me 
Hope they can look back and smile just like we have done 
Never once have I felt the need for another 
We were strong and survived the storm in time to discover 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

All of the smiles we have won 
Just from looking back and reliving all the good times 
And when we've been through all the pages 
We just start again, oh 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you
We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
Tudutu
We've had success (tudutu), we've had good times (tudutu)
But remember this (tudutu)

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there

With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realized what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I look so high you don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of "I can't explain this feeling" now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I made
The fact of reality (oh)

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for more
But remember this

We're not invincible, we're not invincible, no
We're only people, we're only people
Hey we're not invincible, we're not invincible
So again I tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, never forget where
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream (woah)
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing, oh baby
Never, no never, never forget for love
Someday, louder, louder, louder, louder loud

Oh (woah)
Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, louder now
Someday, come on, come on, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody (woah)Can we talk, thoughout the night I need you so bad 
And when we talk can you understand my feelings 
And understand it hurts to be without you 

Never prepared, never know what's going wrong 
I'm loosing though, I always thought this love was so strong 
So alone, so lost in the dark, 
So hurt, cause you will always have a place in my heart 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love, I need it 

Let's take a walk and reminisce about 
The feelings we used to feel 
Just stay the word and I'll be back for good my baby 
I'll be back to give you girl what you deserve 

Don't say too much, did I try to rule your life 
Did the love we had between us 
Miss the road to paradise 
Can we try again, can we chance it one more time 
Can the ecstasy we found here 
Be re-claimed as yours and mine 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your loveI kind of keep asking myself little questions 
Like where do I go from here 
I seem to keep loosing track of time and how long it's been 
Since I last had you near 

Been a painful road to a door that's closed 
Been a gamble that I knew I couldn't win 
Been a lonely conversation to this photograph of you 
In the mirror there's a sing I must give in 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you 

I used to enjoy spending my time on my own here 
Watching the jaded people pass 
Now here I am sharing their pain and their lonely tears 
And walking a road of broken glass 

It's a constant fight to get through each day and night 
It's a war between the present and the past 
And the face that's in your mind every time you close your eyes 
What's the reason, what's the answer, how long will this last 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 

Been a long time since I heard your last goobdye 
Still I hear it clearly every day and night 
What's the point in love when you have to give it up 
Yet still you need it and it's nowhere you can find 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you   
Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

This is the time I feel it 
Here in the middle of the night 
Still wide awake and feeling cheated 
From a girl I thought was treating me right 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

Gotta get away from the feelings I had 
Be real you won't be seeing her again 
It's complicated when you're feeling so bad 
And your girl is still walking away 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true Only one way to describe, this is deceit I am hiding 
Never been here before, never wanna see here again 
I've strayed from a long term lover 
And found greater lust from another 
My conscience is keeping me awake and shouting at me all night 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Being loved is a big responsibility, 
You can never give too much back 
You know it's so easy to walk away and leave that lady flat 
My life's feeling crowded with possessions, am I lucky or sad 
Is it time to turn away and lose everything I had 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Moving in circles, decisions chasing me round and round 
Why's life never easy, or do we make it hard for ourselves 
And when we find love we need to look for something new 
'Cos when it's all over, you always feel the need to be loved 
Like she always loved you 
If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt
Will we lose this chance again?
Strange roads with different signs
Don't even know where we divide
Are you my enemy or my friend?

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

We all grieve in different ways
If one tear could wash away the pain
We're all free to have the faith we believe, yeah
The world sleeps at different times
With one turn your day is now my night
We all live sharing the air that we breathe

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us throughJust have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
That any minute all the pain will stop

Just hold, me close
Inside, your arms, tonight
Don't be to hard on my emotions

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patience

I really wanna start over again
I know you wanna be my salvation
The one that I can always depend
I'll try to be strong, believe me
I'm trying to move on
It's complicated but understand me

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have little patience yeah
Have a little patience yeah

'Cause the scars run so deep
It's been hard, but I have to believe

Have a little patience
Have a little patience

Oh, 'cause I
I just need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I"m still healing
Just try
And have a little patience
Have a little patience
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patienceHere standing in the rain 
The sun has gone again and nothing's gonna change 
Time, I need a little time
As you slip out of sight 
And nothing heals the pain 

And I know that it's you
That's stopping me from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground
'Til I see you again
And you know

[Chorus]
The sun will shine, and we will see
There's nothing standing in our way 
Love will stand and never break 
I never thought this could be me 
Do you feel what I feel
Every time that you are near it's a beautiful world 
A beautiful world 

Words are hard to keep inside 
Even though I've tried, impossible to hide 
And you know that it's me
That's stopping you from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground 
'Til I see you again 
And you know

[Chorus]

I'll be the stars guiding you 
I'll be the place that you hide 
I'd run a thousand miles, a thousand miles
To be by your side

[Chorus]We've been many times before
Leaving rooms and slamming doors
We're climbing up the bedroom walls
Sometimes we make it so frustrating
I touch your mouth, I touch your lips
The answers are our fingertips
Not giving up or giving in
Why are we so complicated?

Oh tell me what to say, tell me
To make it all OK, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna see you hurting
Just hold on
Just hold on to me
I don't wanna see you crying
So hold on
So hold on to me

I'm trying to think of what to do
To really make it up to you
So many truths, too many lies
Making love can be so crazy
I find myself back here again
Asking you to let me in
You know it's time, we need to change
How can we live with all these maybes?

There are no words that say, no words
To make it go away

[Chorus]

Cause baby it's alright
I'm staying here tonight
So hold on

Just tell me what to say
To let you know
I'll always stayWhere, where are the stars?
The one that we used to call ours
Can't imagine it now
We used to laugh til we fell down

The secrets we had, now in the past
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

Now you're so far away
And I see our stars is fading
One too many times
Guess it just got tired of waiting around

The night that we thought, if these walls could talk
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you

So now does he give you love
Oh, Is it only me now that's thinking of, what we had and what we were
Oh, Did you ever care, baby was I ever there?

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
Tell me how, did we lose our way
It's hard to remember, all that we've shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone

There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

It's like I never loved you at all [Repeat: x2]You, you're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, so come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Stop (stop)
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile

Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, oh come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey

(Shine all your light over me)
ShineThere's a place we used to be
There's a face that I used to see
There's a picture with you by my side
There's a moment that I want to find.

I don't know where to start
Or how to begin
But I know I love you still.

If you ever turn away
If you ever change your mind
If the road ahead becomes too hard to climb
If there's something in your heart that tells you to stop
Oh to hold you close tonight
I'd wait for life.

There's a voice shouting inside my head
There's a space on your side of the bed
There's a hope every time there's a sound
There's a silence that's playing too loud

I don't know how you are
Or how you may be
But I know I love you still.

If I close my eyes
I'll dream a little deeper baby
Cause you are always on my mind
Yeah you are always on my mind
For life.I'm afraid of the morning
I'm afraid of the light
You should come with a warning
You should be wearing a sign
That says you're beautiful trouble
So you better beware
One look and I was in right over my head.

Oh this misery
There's no place on earth I'd rather be.

You're not the one I need
You're just the one that I want
Makes a perfect sense to me
You're not the one I need
But you're the one that I want
Ain't no sense of love.

I try to stop myself
So many times
But I keep falling over
I keep crossing the line
The heart of a gypsy and the soul of a stone
It's just a matter of time before you leave ma alone.

Oh sweet misery
Fill my heart up and pour it all over me.

It's not logical
That's the way I feel
It's not logical
Psychological
It's heaven underneath my skin but it's hell out here.What am I to you and what are you to me?
Are we getting better or did we used to be?
What of the song we used to sing?
Where are the souls we used to carry in?
What is a sail without hurricane?
What is a hurt without someone to blame?
Show me the sky and I'll climb the stairs
Give me something 'cause I'm losing it.

Give me what it is you believe in
Cause I give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay.

Tell me the word and I'll shout it out
For what is a voice when in doubt?
The world has changed
The world will change
Oh give me something cause I need to feel.

It's so good you know
I still love you so
And you don't have to do this on your own.
No, noWe used to walk Mancunian Way
We used to swagger we used to sway
Up until the lights took us away
Do you know what you meant to me?
We used to think we were the bomb
Then someone left a real one
We stayed indoors as the rain come
Back then it made no sense to me
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall they gave us the keys to the cit, but they don't fit anything
But I'm coming away.

I hear you calling
I came back running
Forgot that feeling
Been so log coming
They tried to stop her
She just got stronger
I'm driving home again
Back down Mancunian Way

I just forgot how it is to feel
To dance and move and keep it real
Been lying down foot ten long years
But I was there and it feels like yesterday
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall you came when I was pretty, but that don't work no more
But I'm coming anyway.

Now I stand here in front of you
I know now what I'm gonna do
My shoulders low, but my head is high
I'm gonna bring this town alive
Through this acidic rain
I'm gonna come back to life again.A little boy me went fishing in a wooden boat
Sitting there for hours in the cold
Patience is a virtue til we die
Then a ripple in the water caught my eye.

Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for
That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor
We go from green to blue to go to black
Breathe deep, who knows how long will this last.

Only was last week I learnt to drive
Stole my mother's keys and drove all night
Christine never showed it's 4 am
Started up mum's car drove home again.

One year ago I kissed my bride
Now I wait to hear my baby's cry
Woman showed me all that she knew then
To cut himself down man's born again.

Christine died and now I'm here alone
What I wouldn't give to be on that wooden boat.Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah, woah, yeah

I thought I found love
With somebody else's girl, yeah
Ooh

Walkin 'round feeling so broken-hearted
Lost in a different world
Then you came in my life
Bought me back to reality someday

I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love

I will never lose my way again
Ooh yeah

I thought you'd soon be my girl
But my imagination was running wild
Ooh
I wouldn't listen to a single soul
Deep in a sense of denial
But then you rescued me baby
Opened my eyes and made me see you babe
What real love can be

You're the angel that I need

I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love

Don't be sold a dream
Remember how the past has been 
Don't be led to believe this one's for you 
Calculate your needs
I see there's room to plant your seeds 
Don't decide |til you see how the others have grown 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in, oh no
Once you've tasted love 

Still too early to know
Give them time and they will grow 
Don't believe that the first's the one for you 
Most will grow to be tall
Others will break and fall 
Keep your eye on the strongest head of them all 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning 
Your head is spinning 
Once you've tasted love

Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in, oh no
Can't control your mind and your head is still spinning, oh yeah

Once you've tasted love 

You've tasted love, you know it's good 
Come taste my love 
You know you should 

Came into my world and the badness disappears
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I'm gonna work off all your fears

And walk the streets for half the year 
To try to find a new career 
If you get a flu attack 
For thirty days you're on your back 
Doing not a single dance 
Baby give me half a chance 

It only takes a minute girl (only takes a minute girl)
To fall in love, to fall in love (to fall in love)

Waiting for your interview 
They can shoot the whole day for you

And you haven't accomplished a thing 
So baby can't you make me just a little time 
'Cause you never know what's on my mind

Ooh, ooh
Oh yeah
Put your head against my life 
What do you hear 
A million words just trying to make 
The love song of the year 
Close your eyes but don't forget 
What you have heard 
A man who's trying to say three words 
The words that make me scared 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
And here I am 
Here I am
A million love songs later
Here I am

Looking to the future now 
This is what I see 
A million chances pass me by 
A million chances to hold you 
Take me back, take me back 
To where I used to be 
To hide away from all my truth 
Through the light I see 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
Here I am
Just for you girl
A million love songs later
Here I am
I feel for you, babe
Feel for you baby
A million love songs later
Here I, here I amBaby I'm watching you to see 
I don't like the way you've been treating me 
I promised you nothing and gave you much more 
Making love is all you wanted me for 

You're never satisfied, you're never satisfied 
If you open your mind you'll see 
That you could be satisfied with me 

Baby you criticize my every move 
Look, can't you see I've nothing to prove 
I've had enough, it's a matter of time 
Maybe we'll make it somewhere down the line 

You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 

I often wonder what I see in you 
You don't do the things that I want you to do 
I open my eyes and dream it's alright 
Maybe we'll make it together tonight
I'm tired of closing my eyes, to picture you in my mind 
It feels so cold to be alone 
Not sure where I want to be, so close to finding my dream 
We need to hold on to all the times we spoke of love 
Now I pray to God above that someday I can find the door 
I'm looking for 

I can make it, I know I can 
I can save this love forever 
I can make I know I can 
We can make this work together 

It's not a lonely men's dream,it's just that now that there's been 
A taste of love in my life 
That I refuse to return, I've got so much to learn 
How can it feels as though I've reached the top of this steep hill 
For a moment I was standing still 
Now I have the faith I've needed to believe 

'Cause you knop what this love means to me 
You know how it feels when I can see it in your face 
That you're missing me now, you feel I've let you down 
You've gotta hold on, you've gota reach out and believe 

I can make this world a place for me and you 
We can make it, we can make it together 
Do what you like, do what you like
Sugar sweet, if only they all knew 
Jam, can't spread no more you've took my bread 
Energy, just work, no rest or play

So you can do what you like, do what you like 
No need to ask me, do what you want 
Do what you like, do what you like 
No need to tell me, do what you want

Do what you likeStanding back I can't believe
How you've led me on 
And judging by the things you say 
There's gotta be something wrong 
 
What you telling me that for you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
I wanna know 

Seems that I've been playing your game 
And how you think you've won 
But when you count up what you've gained you're the lonely one 

What you telling me that for when you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me

The longer I stayed away for, hidin' from a word
I need to hear now, don't think I'll hear it again (Don't think I'll hear it again)

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (Woah)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Oh yeah)
All I do each night is think (Oh yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within (Closed the door)

If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

But the nights were always warm with you (My love)
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (All I do each night is pray)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Down on my knees)
All I do each night is think (Yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight (Woah)
Of the dream we long to live (We long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times

Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)You've maybe seen me walk behind you 
I follow you just everywhere you go 
I've heard a whisper, they're telling me you've missed her 
I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

Even now I know it doesn't change me 
Maybe someday you'll be free again 
Till then remember, babe I won't surrender 
Still hurts me when I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

You said you've been missing me 
But how can that be girl, how can that be girl 
Now all our plans that used to be passing us by 
You say I want to be freeHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah

For love, and talk the way we used to talk 
'Til we both know what we've lost

When it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No no, love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away
To a town called yesterday 
Love (love) ain't here anymore 

Listen, oh listen, I don't wanna let go 
So maybe we can change the way we feel 
For love, and open up the way we did before 
Now is the right time 
And I'm sure you'd never say the words you did before
Well, it was over 

Love ain't here anymore

So baby, please let me go, let me go 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

All I can see are staring eyes of mystery 
I've tried to look behind before you take my dignity and pride 
We sit and talk all night, still you never seem to lose your height 
You believe in yourself, I hope I'm never gonna need your help 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

You don't want me, you don't need me, I got news now 
'cause baby I'm watching you 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours tooDeceit and lies, is all I've taken 
Let me surface to breath 
No sacrifice, no inspiration 
Can you understand me? 

Why should I ask you, 
Why should I worry? 
You never worry about me 
Why should I ned you, 
Why don't I let you go? 
And let my heartaches run free 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 

What's on my mind, so many questions 
Though the answers I can guess 
You slip away shelter from confrontation 
Look my life is such a mess 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 
You hurt my mind, you hurt my soul 
Never believing what I'm saying 
I'll hunt you down, I'll make you mine 
You'll be the game I've started playing 
And if you won't be there I will know where you're going 
And if you won't be there I will try everyway of showing you that 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I need 

You understand, you realize 
The scene that I'm creating 
And all the while you compromise 
On the liberties I'm taking 
If you don't believe I want just you and I together 
Then you won't believe the dream of you and I forever because 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I needI am just one man with his one pair of eyes 
I dress in normal clothes and I don't try to disguise 
I'm looking out for love however it may seem 
I never do return in the always winning team 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heart 

I had my spills and thrills of love 
And held it in my hand 
I held on tight until it broke 
And I crashed to the ground 
Love cannot be on my side 
It's clearer every dull 
That every time I reach for love 
It always runs away 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heartIt's good to be near you, even though I'm alone 
Reviving memories of our happy home 
No sign of sunlight since you ran away 
These rooms get darker now every day 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

The consequences of freedom 
But now you have what you dreamed 
Just understand that things are not as they seem 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

I don't want to be lonely 
Because you're not there for me to be 
I don't want to be lonely 
I want to be loved 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me?I come to your door to see you again,
But where you once stood was an old man instead
I asked where you'd be, he said she's moved, on you see
All I have is a number you'd better ask her not me
So I picked up the phone and dialed your number
Not sure to put it down or speak
Then a voice I once knew answered in a sweet voice
She said hello then paused before I began to speak

Babe I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

You held your voice well, there were tears I could tell
But where were you now, was you gonna tell me in time?
Just give me a town and I'll be straight down
I've got so much to tell you about where I have been
As I walk down your road, can't wait to be near you
I can't keep the feeling in inside (I, I, I can't keep it inside)
As I stand at your door you answered in a sweet voice
You said hello then pause before I begin to speak

Babe (Babe), I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

As I looked away, I saw a face behind you
A little boy stood at your door
And as I looked again I saw his face was shining
He had my eyes (My eyes), he had my smile (my smile)

Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), please take me back (I'm back again)
Take me back (Babe)
Back here again
Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
Can't you see that I'm back again (Babe)
I'm here for you (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), just me and you (I'm back again)
You and me (Babe)
OohSure, so sure
Sure, so sure
Feel it, move it, feel it, move back
Need you so much, yeah, yeah
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

Sitting here runnin' to my lover (lover)
Last time we met, I wasn't to sure (not so sure)
Now I'm hoping, maybe dreaming, for a life as one
When she reads this I'm hoping she'll call (call me baby)
I need more much, more than before
I need positive reactions, whenever I'm down

'Cause I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking on my door
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

It's not a game, so don't play hard to get
Tired of running after you
There's no connections holding us down (down)
Isn't it a shame (shame), that it never happened (isn't it a shame), oh yeah
Though still here we are the second time round
It's gonna be social, compatible, sexual, irresistible
It's gotta be right for life

Now I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking at my door
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside, yeah
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found, yeah, yeah

Holdin', squeezin', touchin', teasin'
Wantin', wishin', waitin', thinkin'
Of your love, yeah yeah
Blindin', groovin', feel it, move it
Findin', breathin', bracin', breedin'

Sure, so sure, so sure that it's sweet love I foundI guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) I want you back for good

It's our Sunday through our Saturday love 
This ain't no weekend thing this ain't no teenage game 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

I have no reason to be feeling kind of strange 
But I guess that's just the man that I am 
In the clouds, in my dreams in pouring rain 
Hand in hand, under this rainbow we can always still the same 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday loveMaking my way through photographs 
Of the night when you first stood by my side 
Old friends with smiles some are here some are gone 
Good memories of our senior high 
Looking back we're the only couple still together 
Even then I knew this love would be forever, I knew 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

Our lives have all changed we've come a long long way 
Our faces show the lines of two young songs 
And in their houses there will be pictures 
Like the ones of you and me 
Hope they can look back and smile just like we have done 
Never once have I felt the need for another 
We were strong and survived the storm in time to discover 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

All of the smiles we have won 
Just from looking back and reliving all the good times 
And when we've been through all the pages 
We just start again, oh 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you
We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
Tudutu
We've had success (tudutu), we've had good times (tudutu)
But remember this (tudutu)

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there

With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realized what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I look so high you don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of "I can't explain this feeling" now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I made
The fact of reality (oh)

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for more
But remember this

We're not invincible, we're not invincible, no
We're only people, we're only people
Hey we're not invincible, we're not invincible
So again I tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, never forget where
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream (woah)
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing, oh baby
Never, no never, never forget for love
Someday, louder, louder, louder, louder loud

Oh (woah)
Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, louder now
Someday, come on, come on, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody (woah)Can we talk, thoughout the night I need you so bad 
And when we talk can you understand my feelings 
And understand it hurts to be without you 

Never prepared, never know what's going wrong 
I'm loosing though, I always thought this love was so strong 
So alone, so lost in the dark, 
So hurt, cause you will always have a place in my heart 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love, I need it 

Let's take a walk and reminisce about 
The feelings we used to feel 
Just stay the word and I'll be back for good my baby 
I'll be back to give you girl what you deserve 

Don't say too much, did I try to rule your life 
Did the love we had between us 
Miss the road to paradise 
Can we try again, can we chance it one more time 
Can the ecstasy we found here 
Be re-claimed as yours and mine 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your loveI kind of keep asking myself little questions 
Like where do I go from here 
I seem to keep loosing track of time and how long it's been 
Since I last had you near 

Been a painful road to a door that's closed 
Been a gamble that I knew I couldn't win 
Been a lonely conversation to this photograph of you 
In the mirror there's a sing I must give in 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you 

I used to enjoy spending my time on my own here 
Watching the jaded people pass 
Now here I am sharing their pain and their lonely tears 
And walking a road of broken glass 

It's a constant fight to get through each day and night 
It's a war between the present and the past 
And the face that's in your mind every time you close your eyes 
What's the reason, what's the answer, how long will this last 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 

Been a long time since I heard your last goobdye 
Still I hear it clearly every day and night 
What's the point in love when you have to give it up 
Yet still you need it and it's nowhere you can find 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you   
Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

This is the time I feel it 
Here in the middle of the night 
Still wide awake and feeling cheated 
From a girl I thought was treating me right 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

Gotta get away from the feelings I had 
Be real you won't be seeing her again 
It's complicated when you're feeling so bad 
And your girl is still walking away 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true Only one way to describe, this is deceit I am hiding 
Never been here before, never wanna see here again 
I've strayed from a long term lover 
And found greater lust from another 
My conscience is keeping me awake and shouting at me all night 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Being loved is a big responsibility, 
You can never give too much back 
You know it's so easy to walk away and leave that lady flat 
My life's feeling crowded with possessions, am I lucky or sad 
Is it time to turn away and lose everything I had 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Moving in circles, decisions chasing me round and round 
Why's life never easy, or do we make it hard for ourselves 
And when we find love we need to look for something new 
'Cos when it's all over, you always feel the need to be loved 
Like she always loved you 
If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt
Will we lose this chance again?
Strange roads with different signs
Don't even know where we divide
Are you my enemy or my friend?

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

We all grieve in different ways
If one tear could wash away the pain
We're all free to have the faith we believe, yeah
The world sleeps at different times
With one turn your day is now my night
We all live sharing the air that we breathe

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us throughJust have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
That any minute all the pain will stop

Just hold, me close
Inside, your arms, tonight
Don't be to hard on my emotions

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patience

I really wanna start over again
I know you wanna be my salvation
The one that I can always depend
I'll try to be strong, believe me
I'm trying to move on
It's complicated but understand me

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have little patience yeah
Have a little patience yeah

'Cause the scars run so deep
It's been hard, but I have to believe

Have a little patience
Have a little patience

Oh, 'cause I
I just need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I"m still healing
Just try
And have a little patience
Have a little patience
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patienceHere standing in the rain 
The sun has gone again and nothing's gonna change 
Time, I need a little time
As you slip out of sight 
And nothing heals the pain 

And I know that it's you
That's stopping me from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground
'Til I see you again
And you know

[Chorus]
The sun will shine, and we will see
There's nothing standing in our way 
Love will stand and never break 
I never thought this could be me 
Do you feel what I feel
Every time that you are near it's a beautiful world 
A beautiful world 

Words are hard to keep inside 
Even though I've tried, impossible to hide 
And you know that it's me
That's stopping you from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground 
'Til I see you again 
And you know

[Chorus]

I'll be the stars guiding you 
I'll be the place that you hide 
I'd run a thousand miles, a thousand miles
To be by your side

[Chorus]We've been many times before
Leaving rooms and slamming doors
We're climbing up the bedroom walls
Sometimes we make it so frustrating
I touch your mouth, I touch your lips
The answers are our fingertips
Not giving up or giving in
Why are we so complicated?

Oh tell me what to say, tell me
To make it all OK, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna see you hurting
Just hold on
Just hold on to me
I don't wanna see you crying
So hold on
So hold on to me

I'm trying to think of what to do
To really make it up to you
So many truths, too many lies
Making love can be so crazy
I find myself back here again
Asking you to let me in
You know it's time, we need to change
How can we live with all these maybes?

There are no words that say, no words
To make it go away

[Chorus]

Cause baby it's alright
I'm staying here tonight
So hold on

Just tell me what to say
To let you know
I'll always stayWhere, where are the stars?
The one that we used to call ours
Can't imagine it now
We used to laugh til we fell down

The secrets we had, now in the past
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

Now you're so far away
And I see our stars is fading
One too many times
Guess it just got tired of waiting around

The night that we thought, if these walls could talk
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you

So now does he give you love
Oh, Is it only me now that's thinking of, what we had and what we were
Oh, Did you ever care, baby was I ever there?

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
Tell me how, did we lose our way
It's hard to remember, all that we've shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone

There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

It's like I never loved you at all [Repeat: x2]You, you're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down

ShineThere's a place we used to be
There's a face that I used to see
There's a picture with you by my side
There's a moment that I want to find.

I don't know where to start
Or how to begin
But I know I love you still.

If you ever turn away
If you ever change your mind
If the road ahead becomes too hard to climb
If there's something in your heart that tells you to stop
Oh to hold you close tonight
I'd wait for life.

There's a voice shouting inside my head
There's a space on your side of the bed
There's a hope every time there's a sound
There's a silence that's playing too loud

I don't know how you are
Or how you may be
But I know I love you still.

If I close my eyes
I'll dream a little deeper baby
Cause you are always on my mind
Yeah you are always on my mind
For life.I'm afraid of the morning
I'm afraid of the light
You should come with a warning
You should be wearing a sign
That says you're beautiful trouble
So you better beware
One look and I was in right over my head.

Oh this misery
There's no place on earth I'd rather be.

You're not the one I need
You're just the one that I want
Makes a perfect sense to me
You're not the one I need
But you're the one that I want
Ain't no sense of love.

I try to stop myself
So many times
But I keep falling over
I keep crossing the line
The heart of a gypsy and the soul of a stone
It's just a matter of time before you leave ma alone.

Oh sweet misery
Fill my heart up and pour it all over me.

It's not logical
That's the way I feel
It's not logical
Psychological
It's heaven underneath my skin but it's hell out here.What am I to you and what are you to me?
Are we getting better or did we used to be?
What of the song we used to sing?
Where are the souls we used to carry in?
What is a sail without hurricane?
What is a hurt without someone to blame?
Show me the sky and I'll climb the stairs
Give me something 'cause I'm losing it.

Give me what it is you believe in
Cause I give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay.

Tell me the word and I'll shout it out
For what is a voice when in doubt?
The world has changed
The world will change
Oh give me something cause I need to feel.

It's so good you know
I still love you so
And you don't have to do this on your own.
No, noWe used to walk Mancunian Way
We used to swagger we used to sway
Up until the lights took us away
Do you know what you meant to me?
We used to think we were the bomb
Then someone left a real one
We stayed indoors as the rain come
Back then it made no sense to me
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall they gave us the keys to the cit, but they don't fit anything
But I'm coming away.

I hear you calling
I came back running
Forgot that feeling
Been so log coming
They tried to stop her
She just got stronger
I'm driving home again
Back down Mancunian Way

I just forgot how it is to feel
To dance and move and keep it real
Been lying down foot ten long years
But I was there and it feels like yesterday
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall you came when I was pretty, but that don't work no more
But I'm coming anyway.

Now I stand here in front of you
I know now what I'm gonna do
My shoulders low, but my head is high
I'm gonna bring this town alive
Through this acidic rain
I'm gonna come back to life again.A little boy me went fishing in a wooden boat
Sitting there for hours in the cold
Patience is a virtue til we die
Then a ripple in the water caught my eye.

Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for
That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor
We go from green to blue to go to black
Breathe deep, who knows how long will this last.

Only was last week I learnt to drive
Stole my mother's keys and drove all night
Christine never showed it's 4 am
Started up mum's car drove home again.

One year ago I kissed my bride
Now I wait to hear my baby's cry
Woman showed me all that she knew then
To cut himself down man's born again.

Christine died and now I'm here alone
What I wouldn't give to be on that wooden boat.And the fishermen came back across the water 
And the people started running in the park 
And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms 
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us 
And the scent of burning oil was in the air 
And the music played 
And it felt so good to hear 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking 
As the tear from every cloud begin to fall 
For one moment then, we understood it all 

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming 
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women 
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter 
So come on, let me love you 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 
This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon 
A million people walking back to work 
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

You and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah, the gardenToday this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Let's make a new start
The future is ours to find
Can you see it, can you see it in my eyes
Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on (tonight)
Hold on
Hold on

Oh stay close to me (hold on)
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close me

Oh, hold your head high (hold on)
Arms open wide
Yea the world starts to come alive when you stay close it me

Today this could be the greatest day of our lives
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives

Oh and the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
Oh, oh, oh
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive) hold on
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive)
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me (hold on)
Oh (stay close to me) and the world comes alive
(Stay close to me) and the world
Watch the world come alive tonight
(Stay close to me) oh oh oh ohI'd watch the world go by in the morning
Lose myself in the the news
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I don't notice

I'd write a long love song with no meaning
And hope nobody would hear
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming

Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

I'd lock myself away in the evening
Afraid to ever come out
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings

Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh
HelloWhen the tears fall away
And there's no conversation
There's nothing left to break
That's not already broken
You're staring into space
And every inch of silence
Been standing here for days, and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

In the sudden light of day
The weight of expectation
Hurt begins to fade
As you find a new direction
Been talking here for days and days and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we said it all?Julie, what's your problem?
Won't you tell me, what's going on?
Cause there's a dark cloud, hanging over you.
You've been down, down, down too long.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside, and they're playing now, for you, for you.

Julie, come to your window.
Don't let your problems, spoil the view.
It's not a good thing, to cry today.
So come on change change change, come through the door.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now for you.
You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now for you, for you.

Why why why do you cry cry cry?
You should know by now that the sun comes up for you.
Why why why do you cry cry cry?
You should know now that the sun comes up for you, that the sun comes up for you.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now, for you, for you.
You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now, for you, for you.
Sha lalalalala I want you, sha lalalalala I do.Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And I'm going round in circles every day
The more I shout the more I hesitate
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Stand up please til I'm done losing my mind
And I've thanked you all just one too many times
The more we fall the harder we must climb
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Cause everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say, to say

Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And before the music takes you all away
I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to say

I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to sayJust the other day somebody said to me
"Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But jokes aside, I can explain
It's just my way of keeping track
With living on this planet now then

Have you turned on your TV
Have you seen reality
Have you seen a program that you've spent your whole life looking for
There's a girl in Camden town
Indecision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smile at me

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

All the noises and all these lights
All these talking through the nights
All these expectation now
It's making me neurotic
Tell me, have you seen your face before
I forgot to say 'hello'
Thought I'd make it clear now
That I've always been a smiler, tell me
 
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

Sometimes it's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody said to me
"Hey maybe you are oh so slightly OCD
A little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But, jokes aside, please stay with me
It's just my way of compartmentalizing all the things I see

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to thisSometimes I see your face looking at me
All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope I've got wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

I met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"
He met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe (oh maybe) I don't need you to save me (I don't need you to save me)
I just want you to help me (I just want you to help me)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night (Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you'll stayIs it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose to for my valentine? 
What is love? 

Is it only words? 
I'm trying to find? 
Or is it the way, that we're feeling now? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

A pain or a cure? 
A science of faith? 
A reason to fall to your knees and die? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

Only you can save me now. 
Only you can heal me now. 
Only you can show me now, 
What is love. 

Or is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
What is love?Take a piece of
me and throw the rest away (throw it all away)

My lips are moving but you don't hear a word I say (nothing left
to say)

Everybody loves a mystery, everybody needs a reason to believe
Everybody has a history, everybody's hiding something up their
...(sleeve)

sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at all
Play your little game, I'll look the other way (just look the
other way)

everybody wants the sunshine, everybody is a friend of mine
sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at all
Take a closer look inside, take a closer look inside
sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at allYou can dance if you like 
You can sing every line of every song 
No, you don't have to steal the show 
It was your show all along 

As the orchestra plays 
The people take the seats 
There's no room left in this house 
Its only you and me 
And if life is your stage 
I'll be watching 

[Chorus]
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
Ill be watching 
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
And I'll be watching you. 

Everything that you do 
As we start, rehearsing every scene 
The words to everything 
We realize that the crowd is listening 
And then the tears, fall down on your face 
In exactly the right place

[Chorus]Up and down 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see me down life's highway 

Not black or white 
As crystal clear as a cloudy night 
Traveling in the name of lonely 
I was only home when you held me 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to. 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear. 

Flying home tonight 
As far away as a satellite 
Keeping your heart in my pocket 
Hope to God that I don't drop it 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come bursting through my door 

And it's here, 

where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear 
I hear 

Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time to come home 
Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time 

Up and down, 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see my down life's highway 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to 
Is here 
All the things I keep so dear I hear 

Everybody's talking now 
Everybody's walking 'round 
Everybody's dreaming 'boutWoah, woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah, woah, yeah

I thought I found love
With somebody else's girl, yeah
Ooh

Walkin 'round feeling so broken-hearted
Lost in a different world
Then you came in my life
Bought me back to reality someday
Now I don't need a fantasy
You're the only one I need

I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
Ooh

I will never, no I'll never
I will never lose my way again
Ooh yeah

I thought you'd soon be my girl
But my imagination was running wild
Ooh
I wouldn't listen to a single soul
Deep in a sense of denial
But then you rescued me baby
Opened my eyes and made me see you babe
What real love can be

You're the angel that I need

I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
Ooh

I will never, no I'll never
I will never lose my way again

On the wings of love

Heaven sweet sweet baby
On the wings of love
You gave me heaven
Sweet heaven baby, sweet babyLove, once you've tasted love
Love, once you've tasted love
Love, once you've tasted love
Love, once you've tasted love

Don't be sold a dream
Remember how the past has been 
Don't be led to believe this one's for you 
Calculate your needs
I see there's room to plant your seeds 
Don't decide |til you see how the others have grown 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in, oh no
Once you've tasted love 

Still too early to know
Give them time and they will grow 
Don't believe that the first's the one for you 
Most will grow to be tall
Others will break and fall 
Keep your eye on the strongest head of them all 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning 
Your head is spinning 
Once you've tasted love 

Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in, oh no
Can't control your mind and your head is still spinning, oh yeah
(Once you've tasted love) once you've tasted love is just the beginning 
Once you've tasted love 

You've tasted love, you know it's good 
Come taste my love 
You know you should 

Came into my world and the badness disappears
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I'm gonna work off all your fears 
It feels so nice to be with you
Us two, we fit like a glove 
When I see your eyes I realize you too have tasted love 

You've tasted love, you know it's good 
Come taste my love 
You know you shouldIt only takes a minute girl 
It only takes a minute girl 
To fall in love, to fall in love 
It only takes a minute girl 
To fall in love, to fall in love 

What's an hour of the day 
We throw at least one away 
And walk the streets for half the year 
To try to find a new career 
If you get a flu attack 
For thirty days you're on your back 
Doing not a single dance 
Baby give me half a chance 

It only takes a minute girl (only takes a minute girl)
To fall in love, to fall in love (to fall in love)
It only takes a minute girl (it only takes a minute girl)
To fall in love, to fall in love 

Now in the unemployment lines 
You can spend your life reading signs 
Waiting for your interview 
They can shoot the whole day for you 

Now winter's gonna turn to spring 
And you haven't accomplished a thing 
So baby can't you make me just a little time

Ooh, ooh
Oh yeah
Put your head against my life 
What do you hear 
A million words just trying to make 
The love song of the year 
Close your eyes but don't forget 
What you have heard 
A man who's trying to say three words 
The words that make me scared 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
And here I am 
Here I am
A million love songs later
Here I am

Looking to the future now 
This is what I see 
A million chances pass me by 
A million chances to hold you 
Take me back, take me back 
To where I used to be 
To hide away from all my truth 
Through the light I see 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
Here I am
Just for you girl
A million love songs later
Here I am
I feel for you, babe
Feel for you baby
A million love songs later
Here I, here I amBaby I'm watching you to see 
I don't like the way you've been treating me 
I promised you nothing and gave you much more 
Making love is all you wanted me for 

You're never satisfied, you're never satisfied 
If you open your mind you'll see 
That you could be satisfied with me 

Baby you criticize my every move 
Look, can't you see I've nothing to prove 
I've had enough, it's a matter of time 
Maybe we'll make it somewhere down the line 

You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 

I often wonder what I see in you 
You don't do the things that I want you to do 
I open my eyes and dream it's alright 
Maybe we'll make it together tonight
I'm tired of closing my eyes, to picture you in my mind 
It feels so cold to be alone 
Not sure where I want to be, so close to finding my dream 
We need to hold on to all the times we spoke of love 
Now I pray to God above that someday I can find the door 
I'm looking for 

I can make it, I know I can 
I can save this love forever 
I can make I know I can 
We can make this work together 

It's not a lonely men's dream,it's just that now that there's been 
A taste of love in my life 
That I refuse to return, I've got so much to learn 
How can it feels as though I've reached the top of this steep hill 
For a moment I was standing still 
Now I have the faith I've needed to believe 

'Cause you knop what this love means to me 
You know how it feels when I can see it in your face 
That you're missing me now, you feel I've let you down 
You've gotta hold on, you've gota reach out and believe 

I can make this world a place for me and you 
We can make it, we can make it together 
Do what you like, do what you like
Sugar sweet, if only they all knew 
Jam, can't spread no more you've took my bread 
Energy, just work, no rest or play 
Me, myself I'd rather be alone again 

So you can do what you like, do what you like 
No need to ask me, do what you want 
Do what you like, do what you like 
No need to tell me, do what you want 

Cherry pie, you're not as cute as me 
Ice, could never be as cold as you 
Recipe, you stir me up inside 
Me, myself I'd rather be alone again 

So you can do what you like, do what you like 
No need to ask me, do what you want 
Do what you like, do what you like 
No need to tell me, do what you want

Do what you like, do what you like 
No need to tell me, do what you want 
Do what you like, do what you want
No need to ask me, do what you want
Do what you likeStanding back I can't believe
How you've led me on 
And judging by the things you say 
There's gotta be something wrong 
 
What you telling me that for you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
I wanna know 

Seems that I've been playing your game 
And how you think you've won 
But when you count up what you've gained you're the lonely one 

What you telling me that for when you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time (you're gonna promise me)
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
I'll never know

Promises, promises, promises
What you telling me that for when you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
Your promises, promises, promises, promises

Telling lies, telling lies, telling lies

You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of meUno, dos, tres, quattro

We've said goodbye, the taxi cab is waiting
Now don't you cry, just one more kiss
Before I have to go
Hey girl I know the situation changed
And so much is new but something in my life
Remains the same 'cause

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

The rumors true, you know that there've been others
What can I do, I tell you baby they don't mean a thing
Now girl don't go and throw our love away (throw our love away)
I'll be home soon back in your arms to hear you say that

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But I still love you
(Everything changes but you)
I'll spend every single day
Thinking about you

Though everything changes around us
(Baby don't you cry)
We will be the same as before forever more

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

(Everything changes but you)
I'll be thinking about you
Thinking about you
(Everything changes but you)
'Cause you know I love you
Know that I love you

(Everything changes but you)
I'll be thinking about you
Thinking about you
(Everything changes but you)
I love you
I love youWhen the time grew near, for me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for, hidin' from a word
I need to hear now, don't think I'll hear it again (Don't think I'll hear it again)

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (Woah)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Oh yeah)
All I do each night is think (Oh yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within (Closed the door)

If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

But the nights were always warm with you (My love)
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (All I do each night is pray)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Down on my knees)
All I do each night is think (Yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight (Woah)
Of the dream we long to live (We long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

All I do each night is pray (Come on, time is running out)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (You and me)
All I do each night is think, of all the times (On my knees, you and me)
I've closed the door to keep my love within (On my knees)
All I do each night is pray (You and me, forever more)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)You've maybe seen me walk behind you 
I follow you just everywhere you go 
I've heard a whisper, they're telling me you've missed her 
I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

Even now I know it doesn't change me 
Maybe someday you'll be free again 
Till then remember, babe I won't surrender 
Still hurts me when I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

You said you've been missing me 
But how can that be girl, how can that be girl 
Now all our plans that used to be passing us by 
You say I want to be freeHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (come on, yeah), your love is my only desire (I need your love)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need, I need your love

Yeah, you got to be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah)
Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah
Strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side (on the other side)
And I got hope (hope) in my soul, I'll keep walkin' baby
Keep on walkin' baby

Baby 
Don't you want me to go 
So honey, why don't you beg me to stay 
For love, and talk the way we used to talk 
'Til we both know what we've lost 
Never say the words we did before 
When it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No no, love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away
To a town called yesterday 
Love (love) ain't here anymore 

Listen, oh listen, I don't wanna let go 
So maybe we can change the way we feel 
For love, and open up the way we did before 
Now is the right time 
And I'm sure you'd never say the words you did before
Well, it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No, no love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away, to a town called yesterday 
Love (love) don't live here anymore (ooh no no no)

And when I find a place for me to keep my sweet love (keep my sweet love)
Then I will leave it there forever more, yeah 
And when I find someone to share I'll never give up 
I will hold you and believe that this life leads to more 

Oh, love 
No no no
No no no, well it was over
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore (it's gone away, it's gone away, to a town called yesterday)
Love ain't here anymore (don't you beg me to stay, no no no)
Love ain't here anymoreYou came to me, baby 
And I though that I saw love in your eyes 
But all the promises you made were not to be 
I should have seen through your disguise 

Oh no baby you know you always tried 
Make me look the fool, what's goin' on 
You used to be so good to me now what is wrong 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

What has happened to you lately 
I don't sense that lovin', feelin' anymore 
Every time you bring me down I want to cry 
Do you want to see me walkin' out that door 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Oh no baby you know you're always trying 
To make me look the fool 
Won't you tell me why you hurt me 
Is this the love has got to be 
No baby, I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for meI'm mad at you, because af all the things you do 
I want you to see the way your games are hurting me 
So why did I ever fall in love with you 
You're all of my nightmares and dreams come true 

What can I do to make you talk this problem through 
You said you've nothing to hide 
So let me hear your feelings inside 
I never dreamed that I'd see this kind of thing in my life 
So baby, please let me go, let me go 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

All I can see are staring eyes of mystery 
I've tried to look behind before you take my dignity and pride 
We sit and talk all night, still you never seem to lose your height 
You believe in yourself, I hope I'm never gonna need your help 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

You don't want me, you don't need me, I got news now 
'cause baby I'm watching you 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours tooDeceit and lies, is all I've taken 
Let me surface to breath 
No sacrifice, no inspiration 
Can you understand me? 

Why should I ask you, 
Why should I worry? 
You never worry about me 
Why should I ned you, 
Why don't I let you go? 
And let my heartaches run free 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 

What's on my mind, so many questions 
Though the answers I can guess 
You slip away shelter from confrontation 
Look my life is such a mess 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 
You hurt my mind, you hurt my soul 
Never believing what I'm saying 
I'll hunt you down, I'll make you mine 
You'll be the game I've started playing 
And if you won't be there I will know where you're going 
And if you won't be there I will try everyway of showing you that 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I need 

You understand, you realize 
The scene that I'm creating 
And all the while you compromise 
On the liberties I'm taking 
If you don't believe I want just you and I together 
Then you won't believe the dream of you and I forever because 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I needI am just one man with his one pair of eyes 
I dress in normal clothes and I don't try to disguise 
I'm looking out for love however it may seem 
I never do return in the always winning team 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heart 

I had my spills and thrills of love 
And held it in my hand 
I held on tight until it broke 
And I crashed to the ground 
Love cannot be on my side 
It's clearer every dull 
That every time I reach for love 
It always runs away 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heartIt's good to be near you, even though I'm alone 
Reviving memories of our happy home 
No sign of sunlight since you ran away 
These rooms get darker now every day 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

The consequences of freedom 
But now you have what you dreamed 
Just understand that things are not as they seem 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

I don't want to be lonely 
Because you're not there for me to be 
I don't want to be lonely 
I want to be loved 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me?I come to your door to see you again,
But where you once stood was an old man instead
I asked where you'd be, he said she's moved, on you see
All I have is a number you'd better ask her not me
So I picked up the phone and dialed your number
Not sure to put it down or speak
Then a voice I once knew answered in a sweet voice
She said hello then paused before I began to speak

Babe I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

You held your voice well, there were tears I could tell
But where were you now, was you gonna tell me in time?
Just give me a town and I'll be straight down
I've got so much to tell you about where I have been
As I walk down your road, can't wait to be near you
I can't keep the feeling in inside (I, I, I can't keep it inside)
As I stand at your door you answered in a sweet voice
You said hello then pause before I begin to speak

Babe (Babe), I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

As I looked away, I saw a face behind you
A little boy stood at your door
And as I looked again I saw his face was shining
He had my eyes (My eyes), he had my smile (my smile)

Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), please take me back (I'm back again)
Take me back (Babe)
Back here again
Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
Can't you see that I'm back again (Babe)
I'm here for you (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), just me and you (I'm back again)
You and me (Babe)

Need you so much, yeah, yeah

Sitting here runnin' to my lover (lover)
Last time we met, I wasn't to sure (not so sure)
Now I'm hoping, maybe dreaming, for a life as one
When she reads this I'm hoping she'll call (call me baby)
I need more much, more than before
I need positive reactions, whenever I'm down

'Cause I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking on my door
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

It's not a game, so don't play hard to get
Tired of running after you
There's no connections holding us down (down)
Isn't it a shame (shame), that it never happened (isn't it a shame), oh yeah
Though still here we are the second time round
It's gonna be social, compatible, sexual, irresistible
It's gotta be right for life

Now I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking at my door
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside, yeah
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch

I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it

It's our Sunday through our Saturday love 
This ain't no weekend thing this ain't no teenage game 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

I have no reason to be feeling kind of strange 
But I guess that's just the man that I am 
In the clouds, in my dreams in pouring rain 
Hand in hand, under this rainbow we can always still the same 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday loveMaking my way through photographs 
Of the night when you first stood by my side 
Old friends with smiles some are here some are gone 
Good memories of our senior high 
Looking back we're the only couple still together 
Even then I knew this love would be forever, I knew 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

Our lives have all changed we've come a long long way 
Our faces show the lines of two young songs 
And in their houses there will be pictures 
Like the ones of you and me 
Hope they can look back and smile just like we have done 
Never once have I felt the need for another 
We were strong and survived the storm in time to discover 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

All of the smiles we have won 
Just from looking back and reliving all the good times 
And when we've been through all the pages 
We just start again, oh 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you
We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
Tudutu
We've had success (tudutu), we've had good times (tudutu)
But remember this (tudutu)

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there

With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realized what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I look so high you don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of "I can't explain this feeling" now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I made
The fact of reality (oh)

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for more
But remember this

We're not invincible, we're not invincible, no
We're only people, we're only people
Hey we're not invincible, we're not invincible
So again I tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, never forget where
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream (woah)
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing, oh baby
Never, no never, never forget for love
Someday, louder, louder, louder, louder loud

Oh (woah)
Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, louder now
Someday, come on, come on, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody (woah)Can we talk, thoughout the night I need you so bad 
And when we talk can you understand my feelings 
And understand it hurts to be without you 

Never prepared, never know what's going wrong 
I'm loosing though, I always thought this love was so strong 
So alone, so lost in the dark, 
So hurt, cause you will always have a place in my heart 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love, I need it 

Let's take a walk and reminisce about 
The feelings we used to feel 
Just stay the word and I'll be back for good my baby 
I'll be back to give you girl what you deserve 

Don't say too much, did I try to rule your life 
Did the love we had between us 
Miss the road to paradise 
Can we try again, can we chance it one more time 
Can the ecstasy we found here 
Be re-claimed as yours and mine 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your loveI kind of keep asking myself little questions 
Like where do I go from here 
I seem to keep loosing track of time and how long it's been 
Since I last had you near 

Been a painful road to a door that's closed 
Been a gamble that I knew I couldn't win 
Been a lonely conversation to this photograph of you 
In the mirror there's a sing I must give in 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you 

I used to enjoy spending my time on my own here 
Watching the jaded people pass 
Now here I am sharing their pain and their lonely tears 
And walking a road of broken glass 

It's a constant fight to get through each day and night 
It's a war between the present and the past 
And the face that's in your mind every time you close your eyes 
What's the reason, what's the answer, how long will this last 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 

Been a long time since I heard your last goobdye 
Still I hear it clearly every day and night 
What's the point in love when you have to give it up 
Yet still you need it and it's nowhere you can find 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you   
Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

This is the time I feel it 
Here in the middle of the night 
Still wide awake and feeling cheated 
From a girl I thought was treating me right 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

Gotta get away from the feelings I had 
Be real you won't be seeing her again 
It's complicated when you're feeling so bad 
And your girl is still walking away 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true Only one way to describe, this is deceit I am hiding 
Never been here before, never wanna see here again 
I've strayed from a long term lover 
And found greater lust from another 
My conscience is keeping me awake and shouting at me all night 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Being loved is a big responsibility, 
You can never give too much back 
You know it's so easy to walk away and leave that lady flat 
My life's feeling crowded with possessions, am I lucky or sad 
Is it time to turn away and lose everything I had 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Moving in circles, decisions chasing me round and round 
Why's life never easy, or do we make it hard for ourselves 
And when we find love we need to look for something new 
'Cos when it's all over, you always feel the need to be loved 
Like she always loved you 
If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt
Will we lose this chance again?
Strange roads with different signs
Don't even know where we divide
Are you my enemy or my friend?

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

We all grieve in different ways
If one tear could wash away the pain
We're all free to have the faith we believe, yeah
The world sleeps at different times
With one turn your day is now my night
We all live sharing the air that we breathe

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us throughJust have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
That any minute all the pain will stop

Just hold, me close
Inside, your arms, tonight
Don't be to hard on my emotions

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patience

I really wanna start over again
I know you wanna be my salvation
The one that I can always depend
I'll try to be strong, believe me
I'm trying to move on
It's complicated but understand me

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have little patience yeah
Have a little patience yeah

'Cause the scars run so deep
It's been hard, but I have to believe

Have a little patience
Have a little patience

Oh, 'cause I
I just need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I"m still healing
Just try
And have a little patience
Have a little patience
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patienceHere standing in the rain 
The sun has gone again and nothing's gonna change 
Time, I need a little time
As you slip out of sight 
And nothing heals the pain 

And I know that it's you
That's stopping me from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground
'Til I see you again
And you know

[Chorus]
The sun will shine, and we will see
There's nothing standing in our way 
Love will stand and never break 
I never thought this could be me 
Do you feel what I feel
Every time that you are near it's a beautiful world 
A beautiful world 

Words are hard to keep inside 
Even though I've tried, impossible to hide 
And you know that it's me
That's stopping you from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground 
'Til I see you again 
And you know

[Chorus]

I'll be the stars guiding you 
I'll be the place that you hide 
I'd run a thousand miles, a thousand miles
To be by your side

[Chorus]We've been many times before
Leaving rooms and slamming doors
We're climbing up the bedroom walls
Sometimes we make it so frustrating
I touch your mouth, I touch your lips
The answers are our fingertips
Not giving up or giving in
Why are we so complicated?

Oh tell me what to say, tell me
To make it all OK, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna see you hurting
Just hold on
Just hold on to me
I don't wanna see you crying
So hold on
So hold on to me

I'm trying to think of what to do
To really make it up to you
So many truths, too many lies
Making love can be so crazy
I find myself back here again
Asking you to let me in
You know it's time, we need to change
How can we live with all these maybes?

There are no words that say, no words
To make it go away

[Chorus]

Cause baby it's alright
I'm staying here tonight
So hold on

Just tell me what to say
To let you know
I'll always stayWhere, where are the stars?
The one that we used to call ours
Can't imagine it now
We used to laugh til we fell down

The secrets we had, now in the past
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

Now you're so far away
And I see our stars is fading
One too many times
Guess it just got tired of waiting around

The night that we thought, if these walls could talk
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you

So now does he give you love
Oh, Is it only me now that's thinking of, what we had and what we were
Oh, Did you ever care, baby was I ever there?

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
Tell me how, did we lose our way
It's hard to remember, all that we've shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone

There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

It's like I never loved you at all [Repeat: x2]You, you're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, so come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Stop (stop)
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile

Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, oh come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Hey, let me know ya (let me know ya)
You're all that matters to me (you're all that matters to me)
Hey, let me show ya (let me show ya)
You're all that matters to me (you're all that matters to me)

So come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Hey, let me know ya (let me know ya)
You're all that matters to me (you're all that matters to me)
Hey, let me show ya (let me show ya)
You're all that matters to me (you're all that matters)

Hey (let me love ya)

(Shine)
Oh come on (hey)
See the light on your face
(Oh, come on yeah)
Let it shine
Just let it shine
(Shine all your light over me)
ShineThere's a place we used to be
There's a face that I used to see
There's a picture with you by my side
There's a moment that I want to find.

I don't know where to start
Or how to begin
But I know I love you still.

If you ever turn away
If you ever change your mind
If the road ahead becomes too hard to climb
If there's something in your heart that tells you to stop
Oh to hold you close tonight
I'd wait for life.

There's a voice shouting inside my head
There's a space on your side of the bed
There's a hope every time there's a sound
There's a silence that's playing too loud

I don't know how you are
Or how you may be
But I know I love you still.

If I close my eyes
I'll dream a little deeper baby
Cause you are always on my mind
Yeah you are always on my mind
For life.I'm afraid of the morning
I'm afraid of the light
You should come with a warning
You should be wearing a sign
That says you're beautiful trouble
So you better beware
One look and I was in right over my head.

Oh this misery
There's no place on earth I'd rather be.

You're not the one I need
You're just the one that I want
Makes a perfect sense to me
You're not the one I need
But you're the one that I want
Ain't no sense of love.

I try to stop myself
So many times
But I keep falling over
I keep crossing the line
The heart of a gypsy and the soul of a stone
It's just a matter of time before you leave ma alone.

Oh sweet misery
Fill my heart up and pour it all over me.

It's not logical
That's the way I feel
It's not logical
Psychological
It's heaven underneath my skin but it's hell out here.What am I to you and what are you to me?
Are we getting better or did we used to be?
What of the song we used to sing?
Where are the souls we used to carry in?
What is a sail without hurricane?
What is a hurt without someone to blame?
Show me the sky and I'll climb the stairs
Give me something 'cause I'm losing it.

Give me what it is you believe in
Cause I give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay.

Tell me the word and I'll shout it out
For what is a voice when in doubt?
The world has changed
The world will change
Oh give me something cause I need to feel.

It's so good you know
I still love you so
And you don't have to do this on your own.
No, noWe used to walk Mancunian Way
We used to swagger we used to sway
Up until the lights took us away
Do you know what you meant to me?
We used to think we were the bomb
Then someone left a real one
We stayed indoors as the rain come
Back then it made no sense to me
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall they gave us the keys to the cit, but they don't fit anything
But I'm coming away.

I hear you calling
I came back running
Forgot that feeling
Been so log coming
They tried to stop her
She just got stronger
I'm driving home again
Back down Mancunian Way

I just forgot how it is to feel
To dance and move and keep it real
Been lying down foot ten long years
But I was there and it feels like yesterday
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall you came when I was pretty, but that don't work no more
But I'm coming anyway.

Now I stand here in front of you
I know now what I'm gonna do
My shoulders low, but my head is high
I'm gonna bring this town alive
Through this acidic rain
I'm gonna come back to life again.A little boy me went fishing in a wooden boat
Sitting there for hours in the cold
Patience is a virtue til we die
Then a ripple in the water caught my eye.

Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for
That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor
We go from green to blue to go to black
Breathe deep, who knows how long will this last.

Only was last week I learnt to drive
Stole my mother's keys and drove all night
Christine never showed it's 4 am
Started up mum's car drove home again.

One year ago I kissed my bride
Now I wait to hear my baby's cry
Woman showed me all that she knew then
To cut himself down man's born again.

Christine died and now I'm here alone
What I wouldn't give to be on that wooden boat.And the fishermen came back across the water 
And the people started running in the park 
And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms 
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us 
And the scent of burning oil was in the air 
And the music played 
And it felt so good to hear 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking 
As the tear from every cloud begin to fall 
For one moment then, we understood it all 

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming 
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women 
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter 
So come on, let me love you 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 
This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon 
A million people walking back to work 
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

You and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah, the gardenToday this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Let's make a new start
The future is ours to find
Can you see it, can you see it in my eyes
Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on (tonight)
Hold on
Hold on

Oh stay close to me (hold on)
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close me

Oh, hold your head high (hold on)
Arms open wide
Yea the world starts to come alive when you stay close it me

Today this could be the greatest day of our lives
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives

Oh and the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
Oh, oh, oh
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive) hold on
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive)
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me (hold on)
Oh (stay close to me) and the world comes alive
(Stay close to me) and the world
Watch the world come alive tonight
(Stay close to me) oh oh oh ohI'd watch the world go by in the morning
Lose myself in the the news
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I don't notice

I'd write a long love song with no meaning
And hope nobody would hear
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming

Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

I'd lock myself away in the evening
Afraid to ever come out
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings

Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh
HelloWhen the tears fall away
And there's no conversation
There's nothing left to break
That's not already broken
You're staring into space
And every inch of silence
Been standing here for days, and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

In the sudden light of day
The weight of expectation
Hurt begins to fade
As you find a new direction
Been talking here for days and days and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we said it all?Julie, what's your problem?
Won't you tell me, what's going on?
Cause there's a dark cloud, hanging over you.
You've been down, down, down too long.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside, and they're playing now, for you, for you.

Julie, come to your window.
Don't let your problems, spoil the view.
It's not a good thing, to cry today.
So come on change change change, come through the door.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now for you.
You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now for you, for you.

Why why why do you cry cry cry?
You should know by now that the sun comes up for you.
Why why why do you cry cry cry?
You should know now that the sun comes up for you, that the sun comes up for you.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now, for you, for you.
You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now, for you, for you.
Sha lalalalala I want you, sha lalalalala I do.Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And I'm going round in circles every day
The more I shout the more I hesitate
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Stand up please til I'm done losing my mind
And I've thanked you all just one too many times
The more we fall the harder we must climb
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Cause everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say, to say

Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And before the music takes you all away
I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to say

I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to sayJust the other day somebody said to me
"Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But jokes aside, I can explain
It's just my way of keeping track
With living on this planet now then

Have you turned on your TV
Have you seen reality
Have you seen a program that you've spent your whole life looking for
There's a girl in Camden town
Indecision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smile at me

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

All the noises and all these lights
All these talking through the nights
All these expectation now
It's making me neurotic
Tell me, have you seen your face before
I forgot to say 'hello'
Thought I'd make it clear now
That I've always been a smiler, tell me
 
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

Sometimes it's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody said to me
"Hey maybe you are oh so slightly OCD
A little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But, jokes aside, please stay with me
It's just my way of compartmentalizing all the things I see

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to thisSometimes I see your face looking at me
All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope I've got wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

I met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"
He met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe (oh maybe) I don't need you to save me (I don't need you to save me)
I just want you to help me (I just want you to help me)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night (Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you'll stayIs it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose to for my valentine? 
What is love? 

Is it only words? 
I'm trying to find? 
Or is it the way, that we're feeling now? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

A pain or a cure? 
A science of faith? 
A reason to fall to your knees and die? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

Only you can save me now. 
Only you can heal me now. 
Only you can show me now, 
What is love. 

Or is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
What is love?Take a piece of
me and throw the rest away (throw it all away)

My lips are moving but you don't hear a word I say (nothing left
to say)

Everybody loves a mystery, everybody needs a reason to believe
Everybody has a history, everybody's hiding something up their
...(sleeve)

sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at all
Play your little game, I'll look the other way (just look the
other way)

everybody wants the sunshine, everybody is a friend of mine
sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at all
Take a closer look inside, take a closer look inside
sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at allYou can dance if you like 
You can sing every line of every song 
No, you don't have to steal the show 
It was your show all along 

As the orchestra plays 
The people take the seats 
There's no room left in this house 
Its only you and me 
And if life is your stage 
I'll be watching 

[Chorus]
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
Ill be watching 
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
And I'll be watching you. 

Everything that you do 
As we start, rehearsing every scene 
The words to everything 
We realize that the crowd is listening 
And then the tears, fall down on your face 
In exactly the right place

[Chorus]Up and down 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see me down life's highway 

Not black or white 
As crystal clear as a cloudy night 
Traveling in the name of lonely 
I was only home when you held me 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to. 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear. 

Flying home tonight 
As far away as a satellite 
Keeping your heart in my pocket 
Hope to God that I don't drop it 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come bursting through my door 

And it's here, 

where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear 
I hear 

Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time to come home 
Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time 

Up and down, 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see my down life's highway 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to 
Is here 
All the things I keep so dear I hear 

Everybody's talking now 
Everybody's walking 'round 
Everybody's dreaming 'boutI'd watch the world go by in the morning
Lose myself in the the news
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I don't notice

I'd write a long love song with no meaning
And hope nobody would hear
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming

Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

I'd lock myself away in the evening
Afraid to ever come out
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings

Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh
HelloWhen the time grew near, for me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for, hidin' from a word
I need to hear now, don't think I'll hear it again (Don't think I'll hear it again)

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (Woah)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Oh yeah)
All I do each night is think (Oh yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within (Closed the door)

If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

But the nights were always warm with you (My love)
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (All I do each night is pray)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Down on my knees)
All I do each night is think (Yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight (Woah)
Of the dream we long to live (We long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

All I do each night is pray (Come on, time is running out)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (You and me)
All I do each night is think, of all the times (On my knees, you and me)
I've closed the door to keep my love within (On my knees)
All I do each night is pray (You and me, forever more)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong (whenever I'm wrong)
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back (want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good
Oh yeah

I guess now it's time that you came back for goodWe've come so far
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young
And we hope for more

We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
We've had success
We've had good times
But remember this

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there
With danger on my mind
I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realised what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I looked so high I don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of I can't explain this feeling now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I make
And the fact of reality

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far 
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young 
And we hope for more
But remember this
We're not invincible
We're not invincible, no (we're not invincible)
We're only people (ooh)
We're only people (we're not invincible)
Hey we're not invincible (we're not invincible)
We're not invincible
So again I'll tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never (ooh, hoo, hoo) (never! Never! Never!)
Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing ooh baby
Never, no never
Never forget, oh, no
Someday
Louder, louder, louder, louder loud
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, loud now
Someday, come on, come on
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody

Never forget where you're coming from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for moreHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

You can sing every line of every song 
No, you don't have to steal the show 
It was your show all along 

As the orchestra plays 
The people take the seats 
There's no room left in this house 
Its only you and me 
And if life is your stage 
I'll be watching 

[Chorus]
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
Ill be watching 
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
And I'll be watching you. 

Everything that you do 
As we start, rehearsing every scene 
The words to everything 
We realize that the crowd is listening 
And then the tears, fall down on your face 
In exactly the right place

[Chorus]Today this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Let's make a new start
The future is ours to find

Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

(Stay close to me) oh oh oh ohAnd the fishermen came back across the water 
And the people started running in the park 
And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms 
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us 
And the scent of burning oil was in the air 
And the music played 
And it felt so good to hear 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking 
As the tear from every cloud begin to fall 
For one moment then, we understood it all 

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming 
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women 
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter 
So come on, let me love you 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 
This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon 
A million people walking back to work 
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

You and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah, the gardenYou, you're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, so come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Stop (stop)
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile

Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, oh come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine

(Oh, come on yeah)
Let it shine
Just let it shine
(Shine all your light over me)
ShineSometimes I see your face looking at me
All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope I've got wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

I met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"
He met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe (oh maybe) I don't need you to save me (I don't need you to save me)
I just want you to help me (I just want you to help me)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night (Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you'll stayJust the other day somebody said to me
"Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But jokes aside, I can explain
It's just my way of keeping track
With living on this planet now then

Have you turned on your TV
Have you seen reality
Have you seen a program that you've spent your whole life looking for
There's a girl in Camden town
Indecision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smile at me

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

All the noises and all these lights
All these talking through the nights
All these expectation now
It's making me neurotic
Tell me, have you seen your face before
I forgot to say 'hello'
Thought I'd make it clear now
That I've always been a smiler, tell me
 
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

Sometimes it's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody said to me
"Hey maybe you are oh so slightly OCD
A little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But, jokes aside, please stay with me
It's just my way of compartmentalizing all the things I see

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to thisSilence please 'cause I've got something to say
And I'm going round in circles every day
The more I shout the more I hesitate
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Stand up please til I'm done losing my mind
And I've thanked you all just one too many times
The more we fall the harder we must climb
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Cause everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say, to say

Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And before the music takes you all away
I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to say

I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to sayIs it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose to for my valentine? 
What is love? 

Is it only words? 
I'm trying to find? 
Or is it the way, that we're feeling now? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

A pain or a cure? 
A science of faith? 
A reason to fall to your knees and die? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

Only you can save me now. 
Only you can heal me now. 
Only you can show me now, 
What is love. 

Or is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
What is love?When the tears fall away
And there's no conversation
There's nothing left to break
That's not already broken
You're staring into space
And every inch of silence
Been standing here for days, and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

In the sudden light of day
The weight of expectation
Hurt begins to fade
As you find a new direction
Been talking here for days and days and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters

Ooh, ooh
Oh yeah
Put your head against my life 
What do you hear 
A million words just trying to make 
The love song of the year 
Close your eyes but don't forget 
What you have heard 
A man who's trying to say three words 
The words that make me scared 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
And here I am 
Here I am
A million love songs later
Here I am

Looking to the future now 
This is what I see 
A million chances pass me by 
A million chances to hold you 
Take me back, take me back 
To where I used to be 
To hide away from all my truth 
Through the light I see 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
Here I am
Just for you girl
A million love songs later
Here I am
I feel for you, babe
Feel for you baby
A million love songs later
Here I, here I amBaby I'm watching you to see 
I don't like the way you've been treating me 
I promised you nothing and gave you much more 
Making love is all you wanted me for 

You're never satisfied, you're never satisfied 
If you open your mind you'll see 
That you could be satisfied with me 

Baby you criticize my every move 
Look, can't you see I've nothing to prove 
I've had enough, it's a matter of time 
Maybe we'll make it somewhere down the line 

You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 

I often wonder what I see in you 
You don't do the things that I want you to do 
I open my eyes and dream it's alright 
Maybe we'll make it together tonight
I'm tired of closing my eyes, to picture you in my mind 
It feels so cold to be alone 
Not sure where I want to be, so close to finding my dream 
We need to hold on to all the times we spoke of love 
Now I pray to God above that someday I can find the door 
I'm looking for 

I can make it, I know I can 
I can save this love forever 
I can make I know I can 
We can make this work together 

It's not a lonely men's dream,it's just that now that there's been 
A taste of love in my life 
That I refuse to return, I've got so much to learn 
How can it feels as though I've reached the top of this steep hill 
For a moment I was standing still 
Now I have the faith I've needed to believe

You know how it feels when I can see it in your face 
That you're missing me now, you feel I've let you down 
You've gotta hold on, you've gota reach out and believe 

I can make this world a place for me and you 
We can make it, we can make it together 
Do what you like, do what you like

We've said goodbye, the taxi cab is waiting
Now don't you cry, just one more kiss
Before I have to go
Hey girl I know the situation changed
And so much is new but something in my life
Remains the same 'cause

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

The rumors true, you know that there've been others
What can I do, I tell you baby they don't mean a thing
Now girl don't go and throw our love away (throw our love away)
I'll be home soon back in your arms to hear you say that

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But I still love you
(Everything changes but you)
I'll spend every single day
Thinking about you

Though everything changes around us
(Baby don't you cry)
We will be the same as before forever more

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

(Everything changes but you)
I'll be thinking about you
Thinking about you
(Everything changes but you)
'Cause you know I love you
Know that I love you

(Everything changes but you)
I'll be thinking about you
Thinking about you
(Everything changes but you)
I love you
I love youWhen the time grew near, for me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for, hidin' from a word
I need to hear now, don't think I'll hear it again (Don't think I'll hear it again)

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (Woah)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Oh yeah)
All I do each night is think (Oh yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within (Closed the door)

If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

But the nights were always warm with you (My love)
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (All I do each night is pray)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Down on my knees)
All I do each night is think (Yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight (Woah)
Of the dream we long to live (We long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

All I do each night is pray (Come on, time is running out)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (You and me)
All I do each night is think, of all the times (On my knees, you and me)
I've closed the door to keep my love within (On my knees)
All I do each night is pray (You and me, forever more)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)You've maybe seen me walk behind you 
I follow you just everywhere you go 
I've heard a whisper, they're telling me you've missed her 
I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

Even now I know it doesn't change me 
Maybe someday you'll be free again 
Till then remember, babe I won't surrender 
Still hurts me when I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

You said you've been missing me 
But how can that be girl, how can that be girl 
Now all our plans that used to be passing us by 
You say I want to be freeHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (come on, yeah), your love is my only desire (I need your love)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need, I need your love

Yeah, you got to be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah)
Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah
Strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side (on the other side)
And I got hope (hope) in my soul, I'll keep walkin' baby
Keep on walkin' baby

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire (only desire)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire, 'cause I need your loveOh yeah
Baby 
Don't you want me to go 
So honey, why don't you beg me to stay 
For love, and talk the way we used to talk 
'Til we both know what we've lost 
Never say the words we did before 
When it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No no, love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away
To a town called yesterday 
Love (love) ain't here anymore 

Listen, oh listen, I don't wanna let go 
So maybe we can change the way we feel 
For love, and open up the way we did before 
Now is the right time 
And I'm sure you'd never say the words you did before
Well, it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No, no love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away, to a town called yesterday 
Love (love) don't live here anymore (ooh no no no)

And when I find a place for me to keep my sweet love (keep my sweet love)
Then I will leave it there forever more, yeah 
And when I find someone to share I'll never give up 
I will hold you and believe that this life leads to more 

Oh, love 
No no no
No no no, well it was over
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore (it's gone away, it's gone away, to a town called yesterday)
Love ain't here anymore (don't you beg me to stay, no no no)
Love ain't here anymoreYou came to me, baby 
And I though that I saw love in your eyes 
But all the promises you made were not to be 
I should have seen through your disguise 

Oh no baby you know you always tried 
Make me look the fool, what's goin' on 
You used to be so good to me now what is wrong 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

What has happened to you lately 
I don't sense that lovin', feelin' anymore 
Every time you bring me down I want to cry 
Do you want to see me walkin' out that door 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Oh no baby you know you're always trying 
To make me look the fool 
Won't you tell me why you hurt me 
Is this the love has got to be 
No baby, I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for meI'm mad at you, because af all the things you do 
I want you to see the way your games are hurting me 
So why did I ever fall in love with you 
You're all of my nightmares and dreams come true 

What can I do to make you talk this problem through 
You said you've nothing to hide 
So let me hear your feelings inside 
I never dreamed that I'd see this kind of thing in my life 
So baby, please let me go, let me go 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

All I can see are staring eyes of mystery 
I've tried to look behind before you take my dignity and pride 
We sit and talk all night, still you never seem to lose your height 
You believe in yourself, I hope I'm never gonna need your help 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

You don't want me, you don't need me, I got news now 
'cause baby I'm watching you 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours tooDeceit and lies, is all I've taken 
Let me surface to breath 
No sacrifice, no inspiration 
Can you understand me? 

Why should I ask you, 
Why should I worry? 
You never worry about me 
Why should I ned you, 
Why don't I let you go? 
And let my heartaches run free 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 

What's on my mind, so many questions 
Though the answers I can guess 
You slip away shelter from confrontation 
Look my life is such a mess 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 
You hurt my mind, you hurt my soul 
Never believing what I'm saying 
I'll hunt you down, I'll make you mine 
You'll be the game I've started playing 
And if you won't be there I will know where you're going 
And if you won't be there I will try everyway of showing you that 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I need 

You understand, you realize 
The scene that I'm creating 
And all the while you compromise 
On the liberties I'm taking 
If you don't believe I want just you and I together 
Then you won't believe the dream of you and I forever because 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I needI am just one man with his one pair of eyes 
I dress in normal clothes and I don't try to disguise 
I'm looking out for love however it may seem 
I never do return in the always winning team 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heart 

I had my spills and thrills of love 
And held it in my hand 
I held on tight until it broke 
And I crashed to the ground 
Love cannot be on my side 
It's clearer every dull 
That every time I reach for love 
It always runs away 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heartIt's good to be near you, even though I'm alone 
Reviving memories of our happy home 
No sign of sunlight since you ran away 
These rooms get darker now every day 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

The consequences of freedom 
But now you have what you dreamed 
Just understand that things are not as they seem 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

I don't want to be lonely 
Because you're not there for me to be 
I don't want to be lonely 
I want to be loved 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me?I come to your door to see you again,
But where you once stood was an old man instead
I asked where you'd be, he said she's moved, on you see
All I have is a number you'd better ask her not me
So I picked up the phone and dialed your number
Not sure to put it down or speak
Then a voice I once knew answered in a sweet voice
She said hello then paused before I began to speak

Babe I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

You held your voice well, there were tears I could tell
But where were you now, was you gonna tell me in time?
Just give me a town and I'll be straight down
I've got so much to tell you about where I have been
As I walk down your road, can't wait to be near you
I can't keep the feeling in inside (I, I, I can't keep it inside)
As I stand at your door you answered in a sweet voice
You said hello then pause before I begin to speak

Babe (Babe), I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

As I looked away, I saw a face behind you
A little boy stood at your door
And as I looked again I saw his face was shining
He had my eyes (My eyes), he had my smile (my smile)

Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), please take me back (I'm back again)
Take me back (Babe)
Back here again
Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
Can't you see that I'm back again (Babe)
I'm here for you (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), just me and you (I'm back again)
You and me (Babe)

Sitting here runnin' to my lover (lover)
Last time we met, I wasn't to sure (not so sure)
Now I'm hoping, maybe dreaming, for a life as one
When she reads this I'm hoping she'll call (call me baby)

Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong (whenever I'm wrong)
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back (want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good
Oh yeah

Every girl needs a guy like me, oh yeah 
Every guy needs a guy like you, like you 
See cause that's how it's meant to be 

OK so I've stared a little long 
You can take my body, take my fingers and my tongue 
Oh you move like you know what's coming next 
Touching me, touching you, touching all around your legs 
I need you, I need you, I need you you you you you 
Get the message now, I've got to have you girl 

Every guy needs a girl like you, 
Every girl needs a guy like me 
Every guy needs a guy like you 
See cause that's how it's meant to be 

Shall I come over, shall I wait a little more? 
How much longer 'til I walk you through that door? 
Don't hold back the feeling we all know lies deep inside 
It won't be long now till your heart is open wide

See cause that's how it's meant to beMonday morning and the feeling's still the same 
It's our Sunday through our Saturday love 
This ain't no weekend thing this ain't no teenage game 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

I have no reason to be feeling kind of strange 
But I guess that's just the man that I am 
In the clouds, in my dreams in pouring rain 
Hand in hand, under this rainbow we can always still the same 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday loveMaking my way through photographs 
Of the night when you first stood by my side 
Old friends with smiles some are here some are gone 
Good memories of our senior high 
Looking back we're the only couple still together 
Even then I knew this love would be forever, I knew 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

Our lives have all changed we've come a long long way 
Our faces show the lines of two young songs 
And in their houses there will be pictures 
Like the ones of you and me 
Hope they can look back and smile just like we have done 
Never once have I felt the need for another 
We were strong and survived the storm in time to discover 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

All of the smiles we have won 
Just from looking back and reliving all the good times 
And when we've been through all the pages 
We just start again, oh 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you
We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
Tudutu
We've had success (tudutu), we've had good times (tudutu)
But remember this (tudutu)

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there

With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realized what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I look so high you don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of "I can't explain this feeling" now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I made
The fact of reality (oh)

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for more
But remember this

We're not invincible, we're not invincible, no
We're only people, we're only people
Hey we're not invincible, we're not invincible
So again I tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, never forget where
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream (woah)
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing, oh baby
Never, no never, never forget for love
Someday, louder, louder, louder, louder loud

Oh (woah)
Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, louder now
Someday, come on, come on, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody (woah)Can we talk, thoughout the night I need you so bad 
And when we talk can you understand my feelings 
And understand it hurts to be without you 

Never prepared, never know what's going wrong 
I'm loosing though, I always thought this love was so strong 
So alone, so lost in the dark, 
So hurt, cause you will always have a place in my heart 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love, I need it 

Let's take a walk and reminisce about 
The feelings we used to feel 
Just stay the word and I'll be back for good my baby 
I'll be back to give you girl what you deserve 

Don't say too much, did I try to rule your life 
Did the love we had between us 
Miss the road to paradise 
Can we try again, can we chance it one more time 
Can the ecstasy we found here 
Be re-claimed as yours and mine 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your loveI kind of keep asking myself little questions 
Like where do I go from here 
I seem to keep loosing track of time and how long it's been 
Since I last had you near 

Been a painful road to a door that's closed 
Been a gamble that I knew I couldn't win 
Been a lonely conversation to this photograph of you 
In the mirror there's a sing I must give in 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you 

I used to enjoy spending my time on my own here 
Watching the jaded people pass 
Now here I am sharing their pain and their lonely tears 
And walking a road of broken glass 

It's a constant fight to get through each day and night 
It's a war between the present and the past 
And the face that's in your mind every time you close your eyes 
What's the reason, what's the answer, how long will this last 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 

Been a long time since I heard your last goobdye 
Still I hear it clearly every day and night 
What's the point in love when you have to give it up 
Yet still you need it and it's nowhere you can find 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you   
Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

This is the time I feel it 
Here in the middle of the night 
Still wide awake and feeling cheated 
From a girl I thought was treating me right 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

Gotta get away from the feelings I had 
Be real you won't be seeing her again 
It's complicated when you're feeling so bad 
And your girl is still walking away 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true Only one way to describe, this is deceit I am hiding 
Never been here before, never wanna see here again 
I've strayed from a long term lover 
And found greater lust from another 
My conscience is keeping me awake and shouting at me all night 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Being loved is a big responsibility, 
You can never give too much back 
You know it's so easy to walk away and leave that lady flat 
My life's feeling crowded with possessions, am I lucky or sad 
Is it time to turn away and lose everything I had 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Moving in circles, decisions chasing me round and round 
Why's life never easy, or do we make it hard for ourselves 
And when we find love we need to look for something new 
'Cos when it's all over, you always feel the need to be loved 
Like she always loved you 
If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt
Will we lose this chance again?
Strange roads with different signs
Don't even know where we divide
Are you my enemy or my friend?

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

We all grieve in different ways
If one tear could wash away the pain
We're all free to have the faith we believe, yeah
The world sleeps at different times
With one turn your day is now my night
We all live sharing the air that we breathe

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us throughJust have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
That any minute all the pain will stop

Just hold, me close
Inside, your arms, tonight
Don't be to hard on my emotions

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patience

I really wanna start over again
I know you wanna be my salvation
The one that I can always depend
I'll try to be strong, believe me
I'm trying to move on
It's complicated but understand me

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have little patience yeah
Have a little patience yeah

'Cause the scars run so deep
It's been hard, but I have to believe

Have a little patience
Have a little patience

Oh, 'cause I
I just need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I"m still healing
Just try
And have a little patience
Have a little patience
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patienceHere standing in the rain 
The sun has gone again and nothing's gonna change 
Time, I need a little time
As you slip out of sight 
And nothing heals the pain 

And I know that it's you
That's stopping me from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground
'Til I see you again
And you know

[Chorus]
The sun will shine, and we will see
There's nothing standing in our way 
Love will stand and never break 
I never thought this could be me 
Do you feel what I feel
Every time that you are near it's a beautiful world 
A beautiful world 

Words are hard to keep inside 
Even though I've tried, impossible to hide 
And you know that it's me
That's stopping you from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground 
'Til I see you again 
And you know

[Chorus]

I'll be the stars guiding you 
I'll be the place that you hide 
I'd run a thousand miles, a thousand miles
To be by your side

[Chorus]We've been many times before
Leaving rooms and slamming doors
We're climbing up the bedroom walls
Sometimes we make it so frustrating
I touch your mouth, I touch your lips
The answers are our fingertips
Not giving up or giving in
Why are we so complicated?

Oh tell me what to say, tell me
To make it all OK, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna see you hurting
Just hold on
Just hold on to me
I don't wanna see you crying
So hold on
So hold on to me

I'm trying to think of what to do
To really make it up to you
So many truths, too many lies
Making love can be so crazy
I find myself back here again
Asking you to let me in
You know it's time, we need to change
How can we live with all these maybes?

There are no words that say, no words
To make it go away

[Chorus]

Cause baby it's alright
I'm staying here tonight
So hold on

Just tell me what to say
To let you know
I'll always stayWhere, where are the stars?
The one that we used to call ours
Can't imagine it now
We used to laugh til we fell down

The secrets we had, now in the past
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

Now you're so far away
And I see our stars is fading
One too many times
Guess it just got tired of waiting around

The night that we thought, if these walls could talk
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you

So now does he give you love
Oh, Is it only me now that's thinking of, what we had and what we were
Oh, Did you ever care, baby was I ever there?

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
Tell me how, did we lose our way
It's hard to remember, all that we've shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone

There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

It's like I never loved you at all [Repeat: x2]You, you're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, so come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Stop (stop)
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile

Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, oh come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face

(Shine all your light over me)
ShineThere's a place we used to be
There's a face that I used to see
There's a picture with you by my side
There's a moment that I want to find.

I don't know where to start
Or how to begin
But I know I love you still.

If you ever turn away
If you ever change your mind
If the road ahead becomes too hard to climb
If there's something in your heart that tells you to stop
Oh to hold you close tonight
I'd wait for life.

There's a voice shouting inside my head
There's a space on your side of the bed
There's a hope every time there's a sound
There's a silence that's playing too loud

I don't know how you are
Or how you may be
But I know I love you still.

If I close my eyes
I'll dream a little deeper baby
Cause you are always on my mind
Yeah you are always on my mind
For life.I'm afraid of the morning
I'm afraid of the light
You should come with a warning
You should be wearing a sign
That says you're beautiful trouble
So you better beware
One look and I was in right over my head.

Oh this misery
There's no place on earth I'd rather be.

You're not the one I need
You're just the one that I want
Makes a perfect sense to me
You're not the one I need
But you're the one that I want
Ain't no sense of love.

I try to stop myself
So many times
But I keep falling over
I keep crossing the line
The heart of a gypsy and the soul of a stone
It's just a matter of time before you leave ma alone.

Oh sweet misery
Fill my heart up and pour it all over me.

It's not logical
That's the way I feel
It's not logical
Psychological
It's heaven underneath my skin but it's hell out here.What am I to you and what are you to me?
Are we getting better or did we used to be?
What of the song we used to sing?
Where are the souls we used to carry in?
What is a sail without hurricane?
What is a hurt without someone to blame?
Show me the sky and I'll climb the stairs
Give me something 'cause I'm losing it.

Give me what it is you believe in
Cause I give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay.

Tell me the word and I'll shout it out
For what is a voice when in doubt?
The world has changed
The world will change
Oh give me something cause I need to feel.

It's so good you know
I still love you so
And you don't have to do this on your own.
No, noWe used to walk Mancunian Way
We used to swagger we used to sway
Up until the lights took us away
Do you know what you meant to me?
We used to think we were the bomb
Then someone left a real one
We stayed indoors as the rain come
Back then it made no sense to me
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall they gave us the keys to the cit, but they don't fit anything
But I'm coming away.

I hear you calling
I came back running
Forgot that feeling
Been so log coming
They tried to stop her
She just got stronger
I'm driving home again
Back down Mancunian Way

I just forgot how it is to feel
To dance and move and keep it real
Been lying down foot ten long years
But I was there and it feels like yesterday
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall you came when I was pretty, but that don't work no more
But I'm coming anyway.

Now I stand here in front of you
I know now what I'm gonna do
My shoulders low, but my head is high
I'm gonna bring this town alive
Through this acidic rain
I'm gonna come back to life again.A little boy me went fishing in a wooden boat
Sitting there for hours in the cold
Patience is a virtue til we die
Then a ripple in the water caught my eye.

Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for
That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor
We go from green to blue to go to black
Breathe deep, who knows how long will this last.

Only was last week I learnt to drive
Stole my mother's keys and drove all night
Christine never showed it's 4 am
Started up mum's car drove home again.

One year ago I kissed my bride
Now I wait to hear my baby's cry
Woman showed me all that she knew then
To cut himself down man's born again.

Christine died and now I'm here alone
What I wouldn't give to be on that wooden boat.And the fishermen came back across the water 
And the people started running in the park 
And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms 
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us 
And the scent of burning oil was in the air 
And the music played 
And it felt so good to hear 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking 
As the tear from every cloud begin to fall 
For one moment then, we understood it all 

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming 
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women 
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter 
So come on, let me love you 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 
This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon 
A million people walking back to work 
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

You and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah, the gardenToday this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Let's make a new start
The future is ours to find
Can you see it, can you see it in my eyes
Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on (tonight)
Hold on
Hold on

Oh stay close to me (hold on)
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close me

Oh, hold your head high (hold on)
Arms open wide
Yea the world starts to come alive when you stay close it me

Today this could be the greatest day of our lives
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives

Oh and the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
Oh, oh, oh
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive) hold on
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive)
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me (hold on)
Oh (stay close to me) and the world comes alive
(Stay close to me) and the world
Watch the world come alive tonight
(Stay close to me) oh oh oh ohI'd watch the world go by in the morning
Lose myself in the the news
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I don't notice

I'd write a long love song with no meaning
And hope nobody would hear
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming

Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

I'd lock myself away in the evening
Afraid to ever come out
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings

Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh
HelloWhen the tears fall away
And there's no conversation
There's nothing left to break
That's not already broken
You're staring into space
And every inch of silence
Been standing here for days, and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

In the sudden light of day
The weight of expectation
Hurt begins to fade
As you find a new direction
Been talking here for days and days and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we said it all?Julie, what's your problem?
Won't you tell me, what's going on?
Cause there's a dark cloud, hanging over you.
You've been down, down, down too long.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside, and they're playing now, for you, for you.

Julie, come to your window.
Don't let your problems, spoil the view.
It's not a good thing, to cry today.
So come on change change change, come through the door.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now for you.
You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now for you, for you.

Why why why do you cry cry cry?
You should know by now that the sun comes up for you.
Why why why do you cry cry cry?
You should know now that the sun comes up for you, that the sun comes up for you.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now, for you, for you.
You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now, for you, for you.
Sha lalalalala I want you, sha lalalalala I do.Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And I'm going round in circles every day
The more I shout the more I hesitate
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Stand up please til I'm done losing my mind
And I've thanked you all just one too many times
The more we fall the harder we must climb
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Cause everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say, to say

Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And before the music takes you all away
I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to say

I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to sayJust the other day somebody said to me
"Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But jokes aside, I can explain
It's just my way of keeping track
With living on this planet now then

Have you turned on your TV
Have you seen reality
Have you seen a program that you've spent your whole life looking for
There's a girl in Camden town
Indecision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smile at me

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

All the noises and all these lights
All these talking through the nights
All these expectation now
It's making me neurotic
Tell me, have you seen your face before
I forgot to say 'hello'
Thought I'd make it clear now
That I've always been a smiler, tell me
 
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

Sometimes it's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody said to me
"Hey maybe you are oh so slightly OCD
A little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But, jokes aside, please stay with me
It's just my way of compartmentalizing all the things I see

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to thisSometimes I see your face looking at me
All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope I've got wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

I met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"
He met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe (oh maybe) I don't need you to save me (I don't need you to save me)
I just want you to help me (I just want you to help me)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night (Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you'll stayIs it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose to for my valentine? 
What is love? 

Is it only words? 
I'm trying to find? 
Or is it the way, that we're feeling now? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

A pain or a cure? 
A science of faith? 
A reason to fall to your knees and die? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

Only you can save me now. 
Only you can heal me now. 
Only you can show me now, 
What is love. 

Or is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
What is love?Take a piece of
me and throw the rest away (throw it all away)

My lips are moving but you don't hear a word I say (nothing left
to say)

Everybody loves a mystery, everybody needs a reason to believe
Everybody has a history, everybody's hiding something up their
...(sleeve)

sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at all
Play your little game, I'll look the other way (just look the
other way)

everybody wants the sunshine, everybody is a friend of mine
sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at all
Take a closer look inside, take a closer look inside
sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at allYou can dance if you like 
You can sing every line of every song 
No, you don't have to steal the show 
It was your show all along 

As the orchestra plays 
The people take the seats 
There's no room left in this house 
Its only you and me 
And if life is your stage 
I'll be watching 

[Chorus]
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
Ill be watching 
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
And I'll be watching you. 

Everything that you do 
As we start, rehearsing every scene 
The words to everything 
We realize that the crowd is listening 
And then the tears, fall down on your face 
In exactly the right place

[Chorus]Up and down 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see me down life's highway 

Not black or white 
As crystal clear as a cloudy night 
Traveling in the name of lonely 
I was only home when you held me 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to. 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear. 

Flying home tonight 
As far away as a satellite 
Keeping your heart in my pocket 
Hope to God that I don't drop it 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come bursting through my door 

And it's here, 

where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear 
I hear 

Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time to come home 
Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time 

Up and down, 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see my down life's highway 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to 
Is here 
All the things I keep so dear I hear 

Everybody's talking now 
Everybody's walking 'round 
Everybody's dreaming 'boutI'd watch the world go by in the morning
Lose myself in the the news
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I don't notice

I'd write a long love song with no meaning
And hope nobody would hear
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming

Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

I'd lock myself away in the evening
Afraid to ever come out
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings

Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh
HelloWhen the time grew near, for me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for, hidin' from a word
I need to hear now, don't think I'll hear it again (Don't think I'll hear it again)

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (Woah)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Oh yeah)
All I do each night is think (Oh yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within (Closed the door)

If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

But the nights were always warm with you (My love)
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (All I do each night is pray)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Down on my knees)
All I do each night is think (Yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight (Woah)
Of the dream we long to live (We long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

All I do each night is pray (Come on, time is running out)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (You and me)
All I do each night is think, of all the times (On my knees, you and me)
I've closed the door to keep my love within (On my knees)
All I do each night is pray (You and me, forever more)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong (whenever I'm wrong)
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back (want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good
Oh yeah

I guess now it's time that you came back for goodWe've come so far
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young
And we hope for more

We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
We've had success
We've had good times
But remember this

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there
With danger on my mind
I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realised what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I looked so high I don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of I can't explain this feeling now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I make
And the fact of reality

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far 
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young 
And we hope for more
But remember this
We're not invincible
We're not invincible, no (we're not invincible)
We're only people (ooh)
We're only people (we're not invincible)
Hey we're not invincible (we're not invincible)
We're not invincible
So again I'll tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never (ooh, hoo, hoo) (never! Never! Never!)
Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing ooh baby
Never, no never
Never forget, oh, no
Someday
Louder, louder, louder, louder loud
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, loud now
Someday, come on, come on
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody

Never forget where you're coming from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for moreHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (come on, yeah), your love is my only desire (I need your love)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need, I need your love

Yeah, you got to be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah)
Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah
Strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side (on the other side)
And I got hope (hope) in my soul, I'll keep walkin' baby
Keep on walkin' baby

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire (only desire)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire

(Stay close to me) oh oh oh ohAnd the fishermen came back across the water 
And the people started running in the park 
And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms 
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us 
And the scent of burning oil was in the air 
And the music played 
And it felt so good to hear 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking 
As the tear from every cloud begin to fall 
For one moment then, we understood it all 

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming 
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women 
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter 
So come on, let me love you 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 
This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon 
A million people walking back to work 
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

You and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah, the gardenYou, you're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, so come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine

Stop (stop)
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile

Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, oh come on, get it on

ShineSometimes I see your face looking at me
All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope I've got wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

I met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"
He met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe (oh maybe) I don't need you to save me (I don't need you to save me)
I just want you to help me (I just want you to help me)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night (Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you'll stayJust the other day somebody said to me
"Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But jokes aside, I can explain
It's just my way of keeping track
With living on this planet now then

Have you turned on your TV
Have you seen reality
Have you seen a program that you've spent your whole life looking for
There's a girl in Camden town
Indecision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smile at me

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

All the noises and all these lights
All these talking through the nights
All these expectation now
It's making me neurotic
Tell me, have you seen your face before
I forgot to say 'hello'
Thought I'd make it clear now
That I've always been a smiler, tell me
 
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

Sometimes it's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody said to me
"Hey maybe you are oh so slightly OCD
A little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But, jokes aside, please stay with me
It's just my way of compartmentalizing all the things I see

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to thisSilence please 'cause I've got something to say
And I'm going round in circles every day
The more I shout the more I hesitate
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Stand up please til I'm done losing my mind
And I've thanked you all just one too many times
The more we fall the harder we must climb
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Cause everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say, to say

Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And before the music takes you all away
I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to say

I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to sayIs it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose to for my valentine? 
What is love? 

Is it only words? 
I'm trying to find? 
Or is it the way, that we're feeling now? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

A pain or a cure? 
A science of faith? 
A reason to fall to your knees and die? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

Only you can save me now. 
Only you can heal me now. 
Only you can show me now, 
What is love. 

Or is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
What is love?When the tears fall away
And there's no conversation
There's nothing left to break
That's not already broken
You're staring into space
And every inch of silence
Been standing here for days, and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

In the sudden light of day
The weight of expectation
Hurt begins to fade
As you find a new direction
Been talking here for days and days and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

At the start of whatever,
Shouting love at the world.
Back then, we were like cavemen,
But we map the moon and the stars,
Then we forgave them.

We will meet you where the lights are,
The defenders, of the faith we are.
Where the thunder turns around
They'll run so hard we'll tear the ground away.

You know no one dies,
In these love drowned eyes,
Through our love drowned eyes,
We'll watch you sleep tonight.

Although no one understood
We were holding back the flood,
Learning how to dance the rain.
We were holding back the flood
They said we'd never dance again.

Bleeding, but none of us leaving,
Watch your mouth son or you'll find yourself floating home.
Here we come now on a dark star,
Seeing demons, not what we are.

Tiny minds and eager hands
Will try to strike but now will end today.

There's progress now where there once was none,
Where there once was none, then everything came along.

Although no one understood,
We were holding back the flood learning how to dance the rain.
There was more of them than us now they'll never dance again.

Although no one understood

Go tell Eve and go tell Adam
Liberate your sons and daughters
Some are gods and some are monsters
We'll get a five minute warning for divine intervention
With the satellites falling prepare for ascension

Under mind control
We'll be practicing our politics
Defending all our policies
Preparing for apocalypse
Don't let the hungry serpent see you no
No, no, no, no, no

She'll let you fall asleep then eat you whole
It's like a bullet to the head
It's an SOS, it's an S.O.S.,

And Manhattan sinks

When the winter's warm
And the summer's cold
The poison stops you looking old

You'll get a five second warning for divine and intervention
And the satellites are falling prepare for ascension
As the earth looks on
The odds or probability
Of losing all capacity
To function it's hereditary
No antibiotic can save us now
No, no, no, no, no
We are the virus that we talk about

It's like a bullet to the head

We wouldn't be in this place tonight

Lost and lonely, scared and confused
We both have a past, nothing to lose, tonight
Well it cuts like a knife these bad luck blues
We both got scars from the hell we been through
Somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide

Reconnected, feelin' no pain
Seeking shelter like a spark in the rain, tonight (ooh yeah)
Worn and weathered, scared to go home
We're here together, but still all alone, tonight (uh uh yeah)
And there's no need to lie, we've both been abused
The love and the pain, the cocaine and booze, now
Most people don't, but some people do

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collideKings and Queens and Presidents
Ministers of Governments
Welcome to the future of your world

Through talking heads that took liberties
The monkeys learnt to build machines
They think they'll get to heaven through the universe

They say nothing
Deny everything
And make counter accusations

Youth don't leave me, hair stay on me
God I love those hips
Oh memory don't forsake me
Not like this

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectible, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things

They're still out there somewhere
Making men feel this way
At fallen Broadway station
I see them every day, all day

Download a little meditation
It might pull you through
She blinded me with silence
Anchored here with you

Can you give her what she needs

There's a surge in my psychosis every turn of the screw
And I'm half awake in paisley print.
I can see the world clearly but I have to squint.
I am a supersonic specimen.
A minor miracle of medicine
I'm at the mercy of unwanted emotions.
Where nothing matters, beneath my thoughts
Beneath my thoughts is where it happens.
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements, replace me
Was it a positive experiment?
To be indefinitely decadent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I'm at the back of the club and so afraid to speak
Cos I'm not like these people
And these people are not like me
Super heavy elements, upgrade me
Supersonic elements amaze me
Your opinion is irrelevant
I was built to be magnificent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I haven't scratched the surface of my desire
In the world of dreams, I'm a frequent flier
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements,

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I'm feeling immortal
We'll live forever now
We'll live forever nowI, I'm just a piece of your pie chart 
You're in a room with a rock star 
Only I play the good parts of a kind heart 
The sky's too low and the room's too dark 
But she just carries on 
And I get her in but her friend gets turned away 
But what can I say? 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
You might be good looking, 
But you can't sleep with yourself tonight 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 

Oh I, I wish that beggars were choosers 
Unload my love like a looter 
I need some gas and a kick start, for a good heart 
The lighting's cheap, and the room is cold 
But she just carries on 
And you'll get no sleep 
But you might be turned away 
So what will you say? 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
You might be good looking, 
But you can't sleep with yourself tonight 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
If you're so good looking 
Why don't you sleep with yourself tonight? 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
You've gotta get it while you can 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a manMy greatest fear is we're just wasting tears
Wasting several years, still being round here
My greatest fear is maybe you will notice
I'm not what you wanted after all these years

But I, I've got a very big hope for us
I'm gonna keep looking up for us

And I, I still wanna make love with you

What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?It's just a fraction of time,
Until we move into reverse,
Can feel the pressure and all the minds,
And the whole Universe.
Is it a question of force,
And a physical law,
We've had this battle a thousand times,
Never been here before,
Never been here before.

Haven't got the strength to fight anymore,
Got no desire to die anymore,

I want to see you again, again, again,
Haven't got the strength to fight anymore,
Don't even know what I'm fighting forWe became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned
Expendable soldiers smiling at anything
Raised on a feeling our lives would have meaning eventually

We were once the answer and then you discover
You're actually just one thing after another
And what was the question and why was the lesson so deafening?

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And outside forces didn't make it easy
So I thought I'd go before you leave me
Self-preservation was no explanation for anything

But the truth is more than we'll ever comprehend
I'm just starting to understand, my friend
All of that distance, 'cause I fell in love with the enemy

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

At last, we meet on no man's land
Just footprints in the sand
We meet on no man's land, at last

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

One meaning
Just one meaningDarling please forgive me
I was sitting on the fence
I was slowly going out of head
I did not hear a word that you said
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbed

If I could take your blows, If I could get pass go,
If I could find a way of fixing the things that I broke
Then I would, if I could
And I might understand now I ended outta mind
And I might understand now I ended outta mind

But the truth is hard to find
When it's playing tricks with your mind
Darling please forgive me
I was hanging with my friends
I was slowly getting outta my head
I did not hear a word that you said
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbed
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbedWoah, woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah, woah, yeah

I thought I found love
With somebody else's girl, yeah
Ooh

Walkin 'round feeling so broken-hearted
Lost in a different world
Then you came in my life
Bought me back to reality someday
Now I don't need a fantasy

But my imagination was running wild
Ooh

Deep in a sense of denial
But then you rescued me baby
Opened my eyes and made me see you babe
What real love can be

You're the angel that I need

I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love

Don't be sold a dream
Remember how the past has been 
Don't be led to believe this one's for you 
Calculate your needs
I see there's room to plant your seeds 
Don't decide |til you see how the others have grown 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in, oh no
Once you've tasted love 

Still too early to know
Give them time and they will grow 
Don't believe that the first's the one for you 
Most will grow to be tall
Others will break and fall 
Keep your eye on the strongest head of them all 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning 
Your head is spinning

What's an hour of the day 
We throw at least one away 
And walk the streets for half the year 
To try to find a new career 
If you get a flu attack 
For thirty days you're on your back 
Doing not a single dance 
Baby give me half a chance 

It only takes a minute girl (only takes a minute girl)
To fall in love, to fall in love (to fall in love)

Now in the unemployment lines 
You can spend your life reading signs 
Waiting for your interview 
They can shoot the whole day for you 

Now winter's gonna turn to spring 
And you haven't accomplished a thing 
So baby can't you make me just a little time 
'Cause you never know what's on my mind

Ooh, ooh
Oh yeah
Put your head against my life 
What do you hear 
A million words just trying to make 
The love song of the year 
Close your eyes but don't forget 
What you have heard 
A man who's trying to say three words 
The words that make me scared 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
And here I am 
Here I am
A million love songs later
Here I am

Looking to the future now 
This is what I see 
A million chances pass me by 
A million chances to hold you 
Take me back, take me back 
To where I used to be 
To hide away from all my truth 
Through the light I see 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
Here I am
Just for you girl
A million love songs later
Here I am
I feel for you, babe
Feel for you baby
A million love songs later
Here I, here I amBaby I'm watching you to see 
I don't like the way you've been treating me 
I promised you nothing and gave you much more 
Making love is all you wanted me for 

You're never satisfied, you're never satisfied 
If you open your mind you'll see 
That you could be satisfied with me 

Baby you criticize my every move 
Look, can't you see I've nothing to prove 
I've had enough, it's a matter of time 
Maybe we'll make it somewhere down the line 

You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 

I often wonder what I see in you 
You don't do the things that I want you to do 
I open my eyes and dream it's alright 
Maybe we'll make it together tonight
I'm tired of closing my eyes, to picture you in my mind 
It feels so cold to be alone 
Not sure where I want to be, so close to finding my dream 
We need to hold on to all the times we spoke of love 
Now I pray to God above that someday I can find the door 
I'm looking for 

I can make it, I know I can 
I can save this love forever 
I can make I know I can 
We can make this work together 

It's not a lonely men's dream,it's just that now that there's been 
A taste of love in my life 
That I refuse to return, I've got so much to learn 
How can it feels as though I've reached the top of this steep hill 
For a moment I was standing still 
Now I have the faith I've needed to believe 

'Cause you knop what this love means to me 
You know how it feels when I can see it in your face 
That you're missing me now, you feel I've let you down 
You've gotta hold on, you've gota reach out and believe 

I can make this world a place for me and you 
We can make it, we can make it together 
Do what you like, do what you like
Sugar sweet, if only they all knew 
Jam, can't spread no more you've took my bread 
Energy, just work, no rest or play

No need to tell me, do what you want

Do what you likeStanding back I can't believe
How you've led me on 
And judging by the things you say 
There's gotta be something wrong 
 
What you telling me that for you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
I wanna know 

Seems that I've been playing your game 
And how you think you've won 
But when you count up what you've gained you're the lonely one 

What you telling me that for when you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me

All I do each night is pray (Come on, time is running out)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (You and me)
All I do each night is think, of all the times (On my knees, you and me)
I've closed the door to keep my love within (On my knees)
All I do each night is pray (You and me, forever more)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)You've maybe seen me walk behind you 
I follow you just everywhere you go 
I've heard a whisper, they're telling me you've missed her 
I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

Even now I know it doesn't change me 
Maybe someday you'll be free again 
Till then remember, babe I won't surrender 
Still hurts me when I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

You said you've been missing me 
But how can that be girl, how can that be girl 
Now all our plans that used to be passing us by 
You say I want to be freeHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (come on, yeah), your love is my only desire (I need your love)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need, I need your love

Yeah, you got to be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah)
Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah
Strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side (on the other side)
And I got hope (hope) in my soul, I'll keep walkin' baby
Keep on walkin' baby

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire (only desire)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight me fire (relight my fire) relight my fire baby
Relight my fire (I need your love, yeah yeah)

Relight my fire (yeah yeah), your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your loveOh yeah
Baby 
Don't you want me to go 
So honey, why don't you beg me to stay 
For love, and talk the way we used to talk 
'Til we both know what we've lost 
Never say the words we did before 
When it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No no, love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away
To a town called yesterday 
Love (love) ain't here anymore 

Listen, oh listen, I don't wanna let go 
So maybe we can change the way we feel 
For love, and open up the way we did before 
Now is the right time 
And I'm sure you'd never say the words you did before
Well, it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No, no love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away, to a town called yesterday 
Love (love) don't live here anymore (ooh no no no)

And when I find a place for me to keep my sweet love (keep my sweet love)
Then I will leave it there forever more, yeah 
And when I find someone to share I'll never give up 
I will hold you and believe that this life leads to more 

Oh, love 
No no no
No no no, well it was over
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore (it's gone away, it's gone away, to a town called yesterday)
Love ain't here anymore (don't you beg me to stay, no no no)
Love ain't here anymoreYou came to me, baby 
And I though that I saw love in your eyes 
But all the promises you made were not to be 
I should have seen through your disguise 

Oh no baby you know you always tried 
Make me look the fool, what's goin' on 
You used to be so good to me now what is wrong 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

What has happened to you lately 
I don't sense that lovin', feelin' anymore 
Every time you bring me down I want to cry 
Do you want to see me walkin' out that door 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Oh no baby you know you're always trying 
To make me look the fool 
Won't you tell me why you hurt me 
Is this the love has got to be 
No baby, I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for meI'm mad at you, because af all the things you do 
I want you to see the way your games are hurting me 
So why did I ever fall in love with you 
You're all of my nightmares and dreams come true 

What can I do to make you talk this problem through 
You said you've nothing to hide 
So let me hear your feelings inside 
I never dreamed that I'd see this kind of thing in my life 
So baby, please let me go, let me go 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

All I can see are staring eyes of mystery 
I've tried to look behind before you take my dignity and pride 
We sit and talk all night, still you never seem to lose your height 
You believe in yourself, I hope I'm never gonna need your help 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

You don't want me, you don't need me, I got news now 
'cause baby I'm watching you 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours tooDeceit and lies, is all I've taken 
Let me surface to breath 
No sacrifice, no inspiration 
Can you understand me? 

Why should I ask you, 
Why should I worry? 
You never worry about me 
Why should I ned you, 
Why don't I let you go? 
And let my heartaches run free 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 

What's on my mind, so many questions 
Though the answers I can guess 
You slip away shelter from confrontation 
Look my life is such a mess 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 
You hurt my mind, you hurt my soul 
Never believing what I'm saying 
I'll hunt you down, I'll make you mine 
You'll be the game I've started playing 
And if you won't be there I will know where you're going 
And if you won't be there I will try everyway of showing you that 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I need 

You understand, you realize 
The scene that I'm creating 
And all the while you compromise 
On the liberties I'm taking 
If you don't believe I want just you and I together 
Then you won't believe the dream of you and I forever because 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I needI am just one man with his one pair of eyes 
I dress in normal clothes and I don't try to disguise 
I'm looking out for love however it may seem 
I never do return in the always winning team 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heart 

I had my spills and thrills of love 
And held it in my hand 
I held on tight until it broke 
And I crashed to the ground 
Love cannot be on my side 
It's clearer every dull 
That every time I reach for love 
It always runs away 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heartIt's good to be near you, even though I'm alone 
Reviving memories of our happy home 
No sign of sunlight since you ran away 
These rooms get darker now every day 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

The consequences of freedom 
But now you have what you dreamed 
Just understand that things are not as they seem 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

I don't want to be lonely 
Because you're not there for me to be 
I don't want to be lonely 
I want to be loved 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me?I come to your door to see you again,
But where you once stood was an old man instead
I asked where you'd be, he said she's moved, on you see
All I have is a number you'd better ask her not me
So I picked up the phone and dialed your number
Not sure to put it down or speak
Then a voice I once knew answered in a sweet voice
She said hello then paused before I began to speak

Babe I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

You held your voice well, there were tears I could tell
But where were you now, was you gonna tell me in time?
Just give me a town and I'll be straight down
I've got so much to tell you about where I have been
As I walk down your road, can't wait to be near you
I can't keep the feeling in inside (I, I, I can't keep it inside)
As I stand at your door you answered in a sweet voice
You said hello then pause before I begin to speak

Babe (Babe), I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

As I looked away, I saw a face behind you
A little boy stood at your door
And as I looked again I saw his face was shining
He had my eyes (My eyes), he had my smile (my smile)

Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), please take me back (I'm back again)
Take me back (Babe)
Back here again
Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
Can't you see that I'm back again (Babe)
I'm here for you (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), just me and you (I'm back again)
You and me (Babe)
OohSure, so sure
Sure, so sure
Feel it, move it, feel it, move back
Need you so much, yeah, yeah
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

Sitting here runnin' to my lover (lover)
Last time we met, I wasn't to sure (not so sure)
Now I'm hoping, maybe dreaming, for a life as one
When she reads this I'm hoping she'll call (call me baby)
I need more much, more than before
I need positive reactions, whenever I'm down

'Cause I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking on my door
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

It's not a game, so don't play hard to get
Tired of running after you
There's no connections holding us down (down)
Isn't it a shame (shame), that it never happened (isn't it a shame), oh yeah
Though still here we are the second time round
It's gonna be social, compatible, sexual, irresistible
It's gotta be right for life

Now I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking at my door
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside, yeah
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found, yeah, yeah

Holdin', squeezin', touchin', teasin'
Wantin', wishin', waitin', thinkin'
Of your love, yeah yeah
Blindin', groovin', feel it, move it
Findin', breathin', bracin', breedin'
With you girl
It's gonna be social, compatible, sexual, irresistible
It's gotta be right for love

Sure, so sure, oh yeah
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found, yeah, yeah

I need you so much, yeah yeah, oh baby
Sure, so sure, so sure that it's sweet love I foundI guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong (whenever I'm wrong)
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back (want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good
Oh yeah

I guess now it's time that you came back for goodEvery guy needs a girl like you, 
Every girl needs a guy like me, oh yeah 
Every guy needs a guy like you, like you 
See cause that's how it's meant to be 

OK so I've stared a little long 
You can take my body, take my fingers and my tongue 
Oh you move like you know what's coming next 
Touching me, touching you, touching all around your legs 
I need you, I need you, I need you you you you you

Shall I come over, shall I wait a little more? 
How much longer 'til I walk you through that door?

See cause that's how it's meant to beMonday morning and the feeling's still the same 
It's our Sunday through our Saturday love 
This ain't no weekend thing this ain't no teenage game 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

I have no reason to be feeling kind of strange 
But I guess that's just the man that I am 
In the clouds, in my dreams in pouring rain 
Hand in hand, under this rainbow we can always still the same 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday loveMaking my way through photographs 
Of the night when you first stood by my side 
Old friends with smiles some are here some are gone 
Good memories of our senior high 
Looking back we're the only couple still together 
Even then I knew this love would be forever, I knew 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

Our lives have all changed we've come a long long way 
Our faces show the lines of two young songs 
And in their houses there will be pictures 
Like the ones of you and me 
Hope they can look back and smile just like we have done 
Never once have I felt the need for another 
We were strong and survived the storm in time to discover 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

All of the smiles we have won 
Just from looking back and reliving all the good times 
And when we've been through all the pages 
We just start again, oh 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you
We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
Tudutu
We've had success (tudutu), we've had good times (tudutu)
But remember this (tudutu)

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there

With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realized what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I look so high you don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of "I can't explain this feeling" now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I made
The fact of reality (oh)

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for more
But remember this

We're not invincible, we're not invincible, no
We're only people, we're only people
Hey we're not invincible, we're not invincible
So again I tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, never forget where
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream (woah)
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing, oh baby
Never, no never, never forget for love
Someday, louder, louder, louder, louder loud

Oh (woah)
Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, louder now
Someday, come on, come on, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody (woah)Can we talk, thoughout the night I need you so bad 
And when we talk can you understand my feelings 
And understand it hurts to be without you 

Never prepared, never know what's going wrong 
I'm loosing though, I always thought this love was so strong 
So alone, so lost in the dark, 
So hurt, cause you will always have a place in my heart 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love, I need it 

Let's take a walk and reminisce about 
The feelings we used to feel 
Just stay the word and I'll be back for good my baby 
I'll be back to give you girl what you deserve 

Don't say too much, did I try to rule your life 
Did the love we had between us 
Miss the road to paradise 
Can we try again, can we chance it one more time 
Can the ecstasy we found here 
Be re-claimed as yours and mine 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your loveI kind of keep asking myself little questions 
Like where do I go from here 
I seem to keep loosing track of time and how long it's been 
Since I last had you near 

Been a painful road to a door that's closed 
Been a gamble that I knew I couldn't win 
Been a lonely conversation to this photograph of you 
In the mirror there's a sing I must give in 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you 

I used to enjoy spending my time on my own here 
Watching the jaded people pass 
Now here I am sharing their pain and their lonely tears 
And walking a road of broken glass 

It's a constant fight to get through each day and night 
It's a war between the present and the past 
And the face that's in your mind every time you close your eyes 
What's the reason, what's the answer, how long will this last 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 

Been a long time since I heard your last goobdye 
Still I hear it clearly every day and night 
What's the point in love when you have to give it up 
Yet still you need it and it's nowhere you can find 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you   
Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

This is the time I feel it 
Here in the middle of the night 
Still wide awake and feeling cheated 
From a girl I thought was treating me right 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

Gotta get away from the feelings I had 
Be real you won't be seeing her again 
It's complicated when you're feeling so bad 
And your girl is still walking away 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true Only one way to describe, this is deceit I am hiding 
Never been here before, never wanna see here again 
I've strayed from a long term lover 
And found greater lust from another 
My conscience is keeping me awake and shouting at me all night 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Being loved is a big responsibility, 
You can never give too much back 
You know it's so easy to walk away and leave that lady flat 
My life's feeling crowded with possessions, am I lucky or sad 
Is it time to turn away and lose everything I had 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Moving in circles, decisions chasing me round and round 
Why's life never easy, or do we make it hard for ourselves 
And when we find love we need to look for something new 
'Cos when it's all over, you always feel the need to be loved 
Like she always loved you 
If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt
Will we lose this chance again?
Strange roads with different signs
Don't even know where we divide
Are you my enemy or my friend?

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

We all grieve in different ways
If one tear could wash away the pain
We're all free to have the faith we believe, yeah
The world sleeps at different times
With one turn your day is now my night
We all live sharing the air that we breathe

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us throughJust have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
That any minute all the pain will stop

Just hold, me close
Inside, your arms, tonight
Don't be to hard on my emotions

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patience

I really wanna start over again
I know you wanna be my salvation
The one that I can always depend
I'll try to be strong, believe me
I'm trying to move on
It's complicated but understand me

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have little patience yeah
Have a little patience yeah

'Cause the scars run so deep
It's been hard, but I have to believe

Have a little patience
Have a little patience

Oh, 'cause I
I just need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I"m still healing
Just try
And have a little patience
Have a little patience
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patienceHere standing in the rain 
The sun has gone again and nothing's gonna change 
Time, I need a little time
As you slip out of sight 
And nothing heals the pain 

And I know that it's you
That's stopping me from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground
'Til I see you again
And you know

[Chorus]
The sun will shine, and we will see
There's nothing standing in our way 
Love will stand and never break 
I never thought this could be me 
Do you feel what I feel
Every time that you are near it's a beautiful world 
A beautiful world 

Words are hard to keep inside 
Even though I've tried, impossible to hide 
And you know that it's me
That's stopping you from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground 
'Til I see you again 
And you know

[Chorus]

I'll be the stars guiding you 
I'll be the place that you hide 
I'd run a thousand miles, a thousand miles
To be by your side

[Chorus]We've been many times before
Leaving rooms and slamming doors
We're climbing up the bedroom walls
Sometimes we make it so frustrating
I touch your mouth, I touch your lips
The answers are our fingertips
Not giving up or giving in
Why are we so complicated?

Oh tell me what to say, tell me
To make it all OK, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna see you hurting
Just hold on
Just hold on to me
I don't wanna see you crying
So hold on
So hold on to me

I'm trying to think of what to do
To really make it up to you
So many truths, too many lies
Making love can be so crazy
I find myself back here again
Asking you to let me in
You know it's time, we need to change
How can we live with all these maybes?

There are no words that say, no words
To make it go away

[Chorus]

Cause baby it's alright
I'm staying here tonight
So hold on

Just tell me what to say
To let you know
I'll always stayWhere, where are the stars?
The one that we used to call ours
Can't imagine it now
We used to laugh til we fell down

The secrets we had, now in the past
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

Now you're so far away
And I see our stars is fading
One too many times
Guess it just got tired of waiting around

The night that we thought, if these walls could talk
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you

So now does he give you love
Oh, Is it only me now that's thinking of, what we had and what we were
Oh, Did you ever care, baby was I ever there?

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
Tell me how, did we lose our way
It's hard to remember, all that we've shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone

There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

It's like I never loved you at all [Repeat: x2]You, you're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, so come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Stop (stop)
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile

Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, oh come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Hey, let me know ya (let me know ya)
You're all that matters to me (you're all that matters to me)
Hey, let me show ya (let me show ya)
You're all that matters to me (you're all that matters to me)

So come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine

(Oh, come on yeah)
Let it shine
Just let it shine
(Shine all your light over me)
ShineThere's a place we used to be
There's a face that I used to see
There's a picture with you by my side
There's a moment that I want to find.

I don't know where to start
Or how to begin
But I know I love you still.

If you ever turn away
If you ever change your mind
If the road ahead becomes too hard to climb
If there's something in your heart that tells you to stop
Oh to hold you close tonight
I'd wait for life.

There's a voice shouting inside my head
There's a space on your side of the bed
There's a hope every time there's a sound
There's a silence that's playing too loud

I don't know how you are
Or how you may be
But I know I love you still.

If I close my eyes
I'll dream a little deeper baby
Cause you are always on my mind
Yeah you are always on my mind
For life.I'm afraid of the morning
I'm afraid of the light
You should come with a warning
You should be wearing a sign
That says you're beautiful trouble
So you better beware
One look and I was in right over my head.

Oh this misery
There's no place on earth I'd rather be.

You're not the one I need
You're just the one that I want
Makes a perfect sense to me
You're not the one I need
But you're the one that I want
Ain't no sense of love.

I try to stop myself
So many times
But I keep falling over
I keep crossing the line
The heart of a gypsy and the soul of a stone
It's just a matter of time before you leave ma alone.

Oh sweet misery
Fill my heart up and pour it all over me.

It's not logical
That's the way I feel
It's not logical
Psychological
It's heaven underneath my skin but it's hell out here.What am I to you and what are you to me?
Are we getting better or did we used to be?
What of the song we used to sing?
Where are the souls we used to carry in?
What is a sail without hurricane?
What is a hurt without someone to blame?
Show me the sky and I'll climb the stairs
Give me something 'cause I'm losing it.

Give me what it is you believe in
Cause I give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay.

Tell me the word and I'll shout it out
For what is a voice when in doubt?
The world has changed
The world will change
Oh give me something cause I need to feel.

It's so good you know
I still love you so
And you don't have to do this on your own.
No, noWe used to walk Mancunian Way
We used to swagger we used to sway
Up until the lights took us away
Do you know what you meant to me?
We used to think we were the bomb
Then someone left a real one
We stayed indoors as the rain come
Back then it made no sense to me
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall they gave us the keys to the cit, but they don't fit anything
But I'm coming away.

I hear you calling
I came back running
Forgot that feeling
Been so log coming
They tried to stop her
She just got stronger
I'm driving home again
Back down Mancunian Way

I just forgot how it is to feel
To dance and move and keep it real
Been lying down foot ten long years
But I was there and it feels like yesterday
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall you came when I was pretty, but that don't work no more
But I'm coming anyway.

Now I stand here in front of you
I know now what I'm gonna do
My shoulders low, but my head is high
I'm gonna bring this town alive
Through this acidic rain
I'm gonna come back to life again.A little boy me went fishing in a wooden boat
Sitting there for hours in the cold
Patience is a virtue til we die
Then a ripple in the water caught my eye.

Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for
That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor
We go from green to blue to go to black
Breathe deep, who knows how long will this last.

Only was last week I learnt to drive
Stole my mother's keys and drove all night
Christine never showed it's 4 am
Started up mum's car drove home again.

One year ago I kissed my bride
Now I wait to hear my baby's cry
Woman showed me all that she knew then
To cut himself down man's born again.

Christine died and now I'm here alone
What I wouldn't give to be on that wooden boat.And the fishermen came back across the water 
And the people started running in the park 
And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms 
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us 
And the scent of burning oil was in the air 
And the music played 
And it felt so good to hear 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking 
As the tear from every cloud begin to fall 
For one moment then, we understood it all 

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming 
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women 
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter 
So come on, let me love you 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 
This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon 
A million people walking back to work 
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

You and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah, the gardenToday this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Let's make a new start
The future is ours to find
Can you see it, can you see it in my eyes
Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on (tonight)
Hold on
Hold on

Oh stay close to me (hold on)
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close me

Oh, hold your head high (hold on)
Arms open wide
Yea the world starts to come alive when you stay close it me

Today this could be the greatest day of our lives
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives

Oh and the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
Oh, oh, oh
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive) hold on
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive)
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me (hold on)
Oh (stay close to me) and the world comes alive
(Stay close to me) and the world
Watch the world come alive tonight
(Stay close to me) oh oh oh ohI'd watch the world go by in the morning
Lose myself in the the news
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I don't notice

I'd write a long love song with no meaning
And hope nobody would hear
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming

Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

I'd lock myself away in the evening
Afraid to ever come out
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings

Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh
HelloWhen the tears fall away
And there's no conversation
There's nothing left to break
That's not already broken
You're staring into space
And every inch of silence
Been standing here for days, and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

In the sudden light of day
The weight of expectation
Hurt begins to fade
As you find a new direction
Been talking here for days and days and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we said it all?Julie, what's your problem?
Won't you tell me, what's going on?
Cause there's a dark cloud, hanging over you.
You've been down, down, down too long.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside, and they're playing now, for you, for you.

Julie, come to your window.
Don't let your problems, spoil the view.
It's not a good thing, to cry today.
So come on change change change, come through the door.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now for you.
You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now for you, for you.

Why why why do you cry cry cry?
You should know by now that the sun comes up for you.
Why why why do you cry cry cry?
You should know now that the sun comes up for you, that the sun comes up for you.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now, for you, for you.
You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now, for you, for you.
Sha lalalalala I want you, sha lalalalala I do.Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And I'm going round in circles every day
The more I shout the more I hesitate
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Stand up please til I'm done losing my mind
And I've thanked you all just one too many times
The more we fall the harder we must climb
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Cause everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say, to say

Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And before the music takes you all away
I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to say

I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to sayJust the other day somebody said to me
"Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But jokes aside, I can explain
It's just my way of keeping track
With living on this planet now then

Have you turned on your TV
Have you seen reality
Have you seen a program that you've spent your whole life looking for
There's a girl in Camden town
Indecision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smile at me

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

All the noises and all these lights
All these talking through the nights
All these expectation now
It's making me neurotic
Tell me, have you seen your face before
I forgot to say 'hello'
Thought I'd make it clear now
That I've always been a smiler, tell me
 
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

Sometimes it's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody said to me
"Hey maybe you are oh so slightly OCD
A little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But, jokes aside, please stay with me
It's just my way of compartmentalizing all the things I see

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to thisSometimes I see your face looking at me
All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope I've got wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

I met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"
He met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe (oh maybe) I don't need you to save me (I don't need you to save me)
I just want you to help me (I just want you to help me)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night (Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you'll stayIs it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose to for my valentine? 
What is love? 

Is it only words? 
I'm trying to find? 
Or is it the way, that we're feeling now? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

A pain or a cure? 
A science of faith? 
A reason to fall to your knees and die? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

Only you can save me now. 
Only you can heal me now. 
Only you can show me now, 
What is love. 

Or is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
What is love?Take a piece of
me and throw the rest away (throw it all away)

My lips are moving but you don't hear a word I say (nothing left
to say)

Everybody loves a mystery, everybody needs a reason to believe
Everybody has a history, everybody's hiding something up their
...(sleeve)

sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at all
Play your little game, I'll look the other way (just look the
other way)

everybody wants the sunshine, everybody is a friend of mine
sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at all
Take a closer look inside, take a closer look inside
sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at allYou can dance if you like 
You can sing every line of every song 
No, you don't have to steal the show 
It was your show all along 

As the orchestra plays 
The people take the seats 
There's no room left in this house 
Its only you and me 
And if life is your stage 
I'll be watching 

[Chorus]
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
Ill be watching 
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
And I'll be watching you. 

Everything that you do 
As we start, rehearsing every scene 
The words to everything 
We realize that the crowd is listening 
And then the tears, fall down on your face 
In exactly the right place

[Chorus]Up and down 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see me down life's highway 

Not black or white 
As crystal clear as a cloudy night 
Traveling in the name of lonely 
I was only home when you held me 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to. 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear. 

Flying home tonight 
As far away as a satellite 
Keeping your heart in my pocket 
Hope to God that I don't drop it 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come bursting through my door 

And it's here, 

where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear 
I hear 

Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time to come home 
Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time 

Up and down, 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see my down life's highway 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to 
Is here 
All the things I keep so dear I hear 

Everybody's talking now 
Everybody's walking 'round 
Everybody's dreaming 'boutI'd watch the world go by in the morning
Lose myself in the the news
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I don't notice

I'd write a long love song with no meaning
And hope nobody would hear
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming

Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

I'd lock myself away in the evening
Afraid to ever come out
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings

Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh
HelloWhen the time grew near, for me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for, hidin' from a word
I need to hear now, don't think I'll hear it again (Don't think I'll hear it again)

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (Woah)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Oh yeah)
All I do each night is think (Oh yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within (Closed the door)

If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

But the nights were always warm with you (My love)
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (All I do each night is pray)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Down on my knees)
All I do each night is think (Yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight (Woah)
Of the dream we long to live (We long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

All I do each night is pray (Come on, time is running out)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (You and me)
All I do each night is think, of all the times (On my knees, you and me)
I've closed the door to keep my love within (On my knees)
All I do each night is pray (You and me, forever more)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong (whenever I'm wrong)
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back (want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good
Oh yeah

I guess now it's time that you came back for goodWe've come so far
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young
And we hope for more

We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
We've had success
We've had good times
But remember this

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there
With danger on my mind
I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realised what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I looked so high I don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of I can't explain this feeling now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I make
And the fact of reality

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far 
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young 
And we hope for more
But remember this
We're not invincible
We're not invincible, no (we're not invincible)
We're only people (ooh)
We're only people (we're not invincible)
Hey we're not invincible (we're not invincible)
We're not invincible
So again I'll tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never (ooh, hoo, hoo) (never! Never! Never!)
Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing ooh baby
Never, no never
Never forget, oh, no
Someday
Louder, louder, louder, louder loud
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, loud now
Someday, come on, come on
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody

Never forget where you're coming from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for moreHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (come on, yeah), your love is my only desire (I need your love)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need, I need your love

Yeah, you got to be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah)
Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah
Strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side (on the other side)
And I got hope (hope) in my soul, I'll keep walkin' baby
Keep on walkin' baby

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire (only desire)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight me fire (relight my fire) relight my fire baby
Relight my fire (I need your love, yeah yeah)

Relight my fire (yeah yeah), your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your loveYou can dance if you like 
You can sing every line of every song 
No, you don't have to steal the show 
It was your show all along 

As the orchestra plays 
The people take the seats 
There's no room left in this house 
Its only you and me 
And if life is your stage 
I'll be watching 

[Chorus]
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
Ill be watching 
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
And I'll be watching you. 

Everything that you do 
As we start, rehearsing every scene 
The words to everything 
We realize that the crowd is listening 
And then the tears, fall down on your face 
In exactly the right place

[Chorus]Today this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Let's make a new start
The future is ours to find
Can you see it, can you see it in my eyes
Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on (tonight)
Hold on
Hold on

Oh stay close to me (hold on)
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close me

Oh, hold your head high (hold on)
Arms open wide
Yea the world starts to come alive when you stay close it me

Today this could be the greatest day of our lives
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives

Oh and the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
Oh oh oh
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive) hold on
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive)
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me (hold on)
Oh (stay close to me) and the world comes alive
(Stay close to me) and the world
Watch the world come alive tonight
(Stay close to me) oh oh oh ohAnd the fishermen came back across the water 
And the people started running in the park 
And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms 
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us 
And the scent of burning oil was in the air 
And the music played 
And it felt so good to hear 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking 
As the tear from every cloud begin to fall 
For one moment then, we understood it all 

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming 
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women 
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter 
So come on, let me love you 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 
This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon 
A million people walking back to work 
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

You and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah, the gardenYou, you're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, so come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Stop (stop)
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile

Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, oh come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine

Oh come on (hey)
See the light on your face
(Oh, come on yeah)
Let it shine
Just let it shine
(Shine all your light over me)
ShineSometimes I see your face looking at me
All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope I've got wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

I met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"
He met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe (oh maybe) I don't need you to save me (I don't need you to save me)
I just want you to help me (I just want you to help me)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night (Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you'll stayJust the other day somebody said to me
"Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But jokes aside, I can explain
It's just my way of keeping track
With living on this planet now then

Have you turned on your TV
Have you seen reality
Have you seen a program that you've spent your whole life looking for
There's a girl in Camden town
Indecision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smile at me

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

All the noises and all these lights
All these talking through the nights
All these expectation now
It's making me neurotic
Tell me, have you seen your face before
I forgot to say 'hello'
Thought I'd make it clear now
That I've always been a smiler, tell me
 
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

Sometimes it's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody said to me
"Hey maybe you are oh so slightly OCD
A little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But, jokes aside, please stay with me
It's just my way of compartmentalizing all the things I see

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to thisSilence please 'cause I've got something to say
And I'm going round in circles every day
The more I shout the more I hesitate
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Stand up please til I'm done losing my mind
And I've thanked you all just one too many times
The more we fall the harder we must climb
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Cause everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say, to say

Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And before the music takes you all away
I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to say

I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to sayIs it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose to for my valentine? 
What is love? 

Is it only words? 
I'm trying to find? 
Or is it the way, that we're feeling now? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

A pain or a cure? 
A science of faith? 
A reason to fall to your knees and die? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

Only you can save me now. 
Only you can heal me now. 
Only you can show me now, 
What is love. 

Or is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
What is love?When the tears fall away
And there's no conversation
There's nothing left to break
That's not already broken
You're staring into space
And every inch of silence
Been standing here for days, and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

In the sudden light of day
The weight of expectation
Hurt begins to fade
As you find a new direction
Been talking here for days and days and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we said it all?Just have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
That any minute all the pain will stop

Just hold, me close
Inside, your arms, tonight
Don't be to hard on my emotions

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing

And have a little patience

At the start of whatever,
Shouting love at the world.
Back then, we were like cavemen,
But we map the moon and the stars,
Then we forgave them.

We will meet you where the lights are,
The defenders, of the faith we are.
Where the thunder turns around
They'll run so hard we'll tear the ground away.

You know no one dies,
In these love drowned eyes,
Through our love drowned eyes,
We'll watch you sleep tonight.

Although no one understood
We were holding back the flood,
Learning how to dance the rain.
We were holding back the flood
They said we'd never dance again.

Bleeding, but none of us leaving,
Watch your mouth son or you'll find yourself floating home.
Here we come now on a dark star,
Seeing demons, not what we are.

Tiny minds and eager hands
Will try to strike but now will end today.

There's progress now where there once was none,
Where there once was none, then everything came along.

Although no one understood,
We were holding back the flood learning how to dance the rain.
There was more of them than us now they'll never dance again.

Youth don't leave me, hair stay on me
God I love those hips
Oh memory don't forsake me
Not like this

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectible, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things

They're still out there somewhere
Making men feel this way
At fallen Broadway station
I see them every day, all day

Download a little meditation
It might pull you through
She blinded me with silence
Anchored here with you

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectible, why not collect them all

There's a surge in my psychosis every turn of the screw
And I'm half awake in paisley print.
I can see the world clearly but I have to squint.
I am a supersonic specimen.
A minor miracle of medicine
I'm at the mercy of unwanted emotions.
Where nothing matters, beneath my thoughts
Beneath my thoughts is where it happens.
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements, replace me
Was it a positive experiment?
To be indefinitely decadent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I'm at the back of the club and so afraid to speak
Cos I'm not like these people
And these people are not like me
Super heavy elements, upgrade me
Supersonic elements amaze me
Your opinion is irrelevant
I was built to be magnificent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I haven't scratched the surface of my desire
In the world of dreams, I'm a frequent flier
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements,

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I'm feeling immortal
We'll live forever now
We'll live forever nowI, I'm just a piece of your pie chart 
You're in a room with a rock star 
Only I play the good parts of a kind heart 
The sky's too low and the room's too dark 
But she just carries on 
And I get her in but her friend gets turned away 
But what can I say? 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
You might be good looking, 
But you can't sleep with yourself tonight 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 

Oh I, I wish that beggars were choosers 
Unload my love like a looter 
I need some gas and a kick start, for a good heart 
The lighting's cheap, and the room is cold 
But she just carries on 
And you'll get no sleep 
But you might be turned away 
So what will you say? 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
You might be good looking, 
But you can't sleep with yourself tonight 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
If you're so good looking 
Why don't you sleep with yourself tonight? 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
You've gotta get it while you can 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a manMy greatest fear is we're just wasting tears
Wasting several years, still being round here
My greatest fear is maybe you will notice
I'm not what you wanted after all these years

But I, I've got a very big hope for us
I'm gonna keep looking up for us
It's been a difficult year
And I, I still wanna make love with you
So where do we go from here?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I still think I belong with you,
I still wanna belong to you
So what do you want from me
What do you want from me now?

Your greatest fear is we're not getting wiser,
We're not wise at all
It's getting harder, harder to recover
From the night before, when you turn me on
But I, I like to think of us moving on
I like to think of us getting on
So answer me where do we go from here,
Where do we go?

Because I, I still wanna get old with you
I still want us to grow
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I still think I'm in love with you
I still feel you're the one
So what do you want from me,
What do you want from me now?

Has it crossed your mind we might already know?
If we only let it go?

Yeah I, I still wanna have sex with you
I still wanna go out with you
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I think some days we're beautiful
I think some days we're not
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?

Let's make it positive
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?
We're making progress here, so where shall we go?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?My greatest fear is we're just wasting tears
Wasting several years, still being round here
My greatest fear is maybe you will notice
I'm not what you wanted after all these years

But I, I've got a very big hope for us

Let's make it positive
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?
We're making progress here, so where shall we go?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?It's just a fraction of time,
Until we move into reverse,
Can feel the pressure and all the minds,
And the whole Universe.
Is it a question of force,
And a physical law,
We've had this battle a thousand times,
Never been here before,
Never been here before.

Haven't got the strength to fight anymore,
Got no desire to die anymore,

I want to see you again, again, again,
Haven't got the strength to fight anymore,
Don't even know what I'm fighting forWe became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned
Expendable soldiers smiling at anything
Raised on a feeling our lives would have meaning eventually

We were once the answer and then you discover
You're actually just one thing after another
And what was the question and why was the lesson so deafening?

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And outside forces didn't make it easy
So I thought I'd go before you leave me
Self-preservation was no explanation for anything

But the truth is more than we'll ever comprehend
I'm just starting to understand, my friend
All of that distance, 'cause I fell in love with the enemy

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

At last, we meet on no man's land
Just footprints in the sand
We meet on no man's land, at last

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

One meaning
Just one meaningDarling please forgive me
I was sitting on the fence
I was slowly going out of head
I did not hear a word that you said
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbed

If I could take your blows, If I could get pass go,
If I could find a way of fixing the things that I broke
Then I would, if I could
And I might understand now I ended outta mind
And I might understand now I ended outta mind

But the truth is hard to find
When it's playing tricks with your mind
Darling please forgive me
I was hanging with my friends
I was slowly getting outta my head

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all?
The Good, the Bad, the Ugly or the Beautiful

Because it's up hill and against the wind
With no-one there to let us in
Leave your thoughts and save yourself you fool

The daggers of science
Evolving into violence
We're not sure where the fallout blows
But we all know ·

There'll be trouble when the kidz come out (come out)

Boys go crazy over you
Grip like a new york window cleaner
Just staring at you

Youth don't leave me, hair stay on me
God I love those hips
Oh memory don't forsake me
Not like this

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectible, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things

They're still out there somewhere
Making men feel this way
At fallen Broadway station
I see them every day, all day

Download a little meditation
It might pull you through
She blinded me with silence
Anchored here with you

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectible, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectible, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things

Does she talk like ooh ooh ooh
Will it feel like ah ah ah
Does she tell you what she wants
Can you give her what she needs

Youth don't leave me, hair stay on me, god I love those hips
Oh memory don't forsake me, not like this

All those pretty things, god bless the pretty thingsI get the feeling that we are being lied to,
There's a surge in my psychosis every turn of the screw
And I'm half awake in paisley print.
I can see the world clearly but I have to squint.
I am a supersonic specimen.
A minor miracle of medicine
I'm at the mercy of unwanted emotions.
Where nothing matters, beneath my thoughts
Beneath my thoughts is where it happens.
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements, replace me
Was it a positive experiment?
To be indefinitely decadent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I'm at the back of the club and so afraid to speak
Cos I'm not like these people
And these people are not like me
Super heavy elements, upgrade me
Supersonic elements amaze me
Your opinion is irrelevant
I was built to be magnificent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I haven't scratched the surface of my desire
In the world of dreams, I'm a frequent flier
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements,

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I'm feeling immortal
We'll live forever now
We'll live forever nowI, I'm just a piece of your pie chart 
You're in a room with a rock star 
Only I play the good parts of a kind heart 
The sky's too low and the room's too dark 
But she just carries on 
And I get her in but her friend gets turned away 
But what can I say? 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
You might be good looking, 
But you can't sleep with yourself tonight 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 

Oh I, I wish that beggars were choosers 
Unload my love like a looter 
I need some gas and a kick start, for a good heart 
The lighting's cheap, and the room is cold 
But she just carries on 
And you'll get no sleep 
But you might be turned away 
So what will you say? 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
You might be good looking, 
But you can't sleep with yourself tonight 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
If you're so good looking 
Why don't you sleep with yourself tonight? 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
You've gotta get it while you can 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a manMy greatest fear is we're just wasting tears
Wasting several years, still being round here
My greatest fear is maybe you will notice
I'm not what you wanted after all these years

But I, I've got a very big hope for us
I'm gonna keep looking up for us
It's been a difficult year
And I, I still wanna make love with you
So where do we go from here?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I still think I belong with you,
I still wanna belong to you
So what do you want from me
What do you want from me now?

Your greatest fear is we're not getting wiser,
We're not wise at all
It's getting harder, harder to recover
From the night before, when you turn me on
But I, I like to think of us moving on
I like to think of us getting on
So answer me where do we go from here,
Where do we go?

Because I, I still wanna get old with you
I still want us to grow
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I still think I'm in love with you
I still feel you're the one
So what do you want from me,
What do you want from me now?

Has it crossed your mind we might already know?
If we only let it go?

Yeah I, I still wanna have sex with you
I still wanna go out with you
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I think some days we're beautiful
I think some days we're not
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?

Let's make it positive
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?
We're making progress here, so where shall we go?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?It's just a fraction of time,
Until we move into reverse,
Can feel the pressure and all the minds,
And the whole Universe.
Is it a question of force,
And a physical law,
We've had this battle a thousand times,
Never been here before,
Never been here before.

Haven't got the strength to fight anymore,
Got no desire to die anymore,

I want to see you again, again, again,
Haven't got the strength to fight anymore,
Don't even know what I'm fighting forWe became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned
Expendable soldiers smiling at anything
Raised on a feeling our lives would have meaning eventually

We were once the answer and then you discover
You're actually just one thing after another
And what was the question and why was the lesson so deafening?

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And outside forces didn't make it easy
So I thought I'd go before you leave me
Self-preservation was no explanation for anything

But the truth is more than we'll ever comprehend
I'm just starting to understand, my friend
All of that distance, 'cause I fell in love with the enemy

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

At last, we meet on no man's land
Just footprints in the sand
We meet on no man's land, at last

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

One meaning
Just one meaningWhen we were young the world seemed so old
Careless and cold
We did what we were told in our lives
When we were young
Had the world by the tail
Good would prevail
Starships at sail
And none of us would fail in this life
Not when you're young

We were drawn to whoever could keep us together
And bound by the heavens above
And we tried to survive traveling at the speed of love

Woah when we were young
When we adored the fabulous
Woah when we were young
We were the foolish fearless
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
Woah when we were young

In a moment of grace
A long leap of faith
The still more glorious dawn awaits
It's my life
I'm here with the lovers

And we burned the bridges
We're crossing over
Just to see the firelight
And the innocent are getting over
Being old tonight

Woah when we were young
When everything was what it seemed
Woah when we were young
And everyday was how we dreamed
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
Woah when we were young

And when you look at yourself tonight
Are you someone you recognize?
You can take back what you've given away
But it must be the last time

Woah when we were young
Woah when we were young
When we were young

Woah when we were young
When we adored the fabulous
Woah when we were young
We were the foolish fearless
Woah when we were young
We didn't know it wouldn't last
Woah when we were youngMan

You had it all, you had it all
You lost control and let it go again
We're waiting for the universe to end

You much too strong for me
And I can't hold your hand like I used to
You much too hard for me
And I can't change your heart like I used to

It's to smile when the lights are on
This never was enough for you
Now we both know where we belong

The work is done
A place for everything til everything is in its place
And every setting sun
When the work was done
Was a day that didn't go to waste
When all the work is done
It will be done
Producing everything for everything to be replaced
And in dirty towns we will settle down
Manufacture for the human race

The greatest story that was ever told in the lights of history
Was the grand designs of other men
And they built those walls for you and me

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men
Don't start thinking with your heart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men

When the work is done, the work is done
We'll bebionic and beyond the circuits of our minds
We'll get nothing done under electric sun
Leave the weight of labor far behind

We're the greatest story that was ever told
But we don't know where we're from
And the walls became but a memory
Of the days when all the work begun

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men

Rejoice the day, the day the work is done
Rejoice the day, the day the work is done

Everybody's counting hours
Everybody's counting hours

Til the day the work is done
Til the day the work is done

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again

Rejoice the day, the day the work is done

Everybody's counting hours
Everybody's counting hoursLet all that's simple pass you by
Let all that lives be free to die
We're all, we're all key to life
Face all that rage and history
It makes no sense to you and me
We're all, we're all free to fight
I broke all my vows, my common sense
Says find vocation somewhere else

This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
Tonight

Lay all that's sinful down to rest
May all our judgments be confessed
We're all, we're all guilty now
Drink for the crowd not for yourself
Til someone hears your cry for help
Let's all, let's all take a bow
I spent all my mind on making sense
It made no difference in the end
This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
Tonight

I close my eyes and I am somebody else
Tonight I close my eyes and I don't need any help
Every moment of laughter
Every moment I fear
Every moment that you're not here

This should've been so beautiful, so beautiful, be so beautiful
This should have been so beautiful, been so beautiful

This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
TonightDon't stay where you are not loved
Those people obscure the view
But if I've done my job
They won't wanna mess with you

Finding some romances
A place where you exist
Live with your mother' smile
But see you through daddy's eyes

You might lose your dignity
But it's not what it used to be

And don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like kings and queens
I'll be the first, the last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to me

Just listen to your heart
Not the voices in your head
Forget how it'd made you feel
But don't forget what was said

Tears are words than we can touch
When words only say so much
Look out? what you've got
Then you'll always have enough

You might lose your dignity
But look what its done for me

And don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like kings and queens
I'll be the first, the last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to me

And don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like kings and queens

What a wonderful world this is
It makes me want to kiss
What a beautiful kiss this is
What a beautiful kiss of life
Just before I die
I've been spending time
I've been losing time

Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet
All those minutes get lost in time
One step forward two steps behind
So before I think myself too deep
What a wonderful world this is
What a wonderful world this is
What a delicate tale of bliss
That I don't want to miss
In this moment where we all exist
On the precipice of the abyss
It always was, how it is
Spending time, wasting time
I've been spending time, I've been wasting time

Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet
All those minutes get lost in time
One step forward two steps behind
So before I think myself too deep
What a wonderful world this is

No time
Am I losing my mind
No time
Am I losing my mind
There's no time for us, no time for us until we're out of time (we're
Running out of time)
There's no time for us, no time
What a wonderful world this is
There's no time for us, no time (we're running out of time)

But it was never ours to keep
Time was all we had

I thought I found love
With somebody else's girl, yeah
Ooh

Walkin 'round feeling so broken-hearted
Lost in a different world
Then you came in my life
Bought me back to reality someday
Now I don't need a fantasy
You're the only one I need

I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
Ooh

I will never, no I'll never
I will never lose my way again
Ooh yeah

I thought you'd soon be my girl
But my imagination was running wild
Ooh
I wouldn't listen to a single soul
Deep in a sense of denial
But then you rescued me baby
Opened my eyes and made me see you babe
What real love can be

You're the angel that I need

I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love

Don't be sold a dream
Remember how the past has been 
Don't be led to believe this one's for you 
Calculate your needs
I see there's room to plant your seeds 
Don't decide |til you see how the others have grown 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in, oh no
Once you've tasted love 

Still too early to know
Give them time and they will grow 
Don't believe that the first's the one for you 
Most will grow to be tall
Others will break and fall 
Keep your eye on the strongest head of them all 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning 
Your head is spinning 
Once you've tasted love 

Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in, oh no
Can't control your mind and your head is still spinning, oh yeah
(Once you've tasted love) once you've tasted love is just the beginning 
Once you've tasted love 

You've tasted love, you know it's good 
Come taste my love 
You know you should 

Came into my world and the badness disappears
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I'm gonna work off all your fears 
It feels so nice to be with you

Put your head against my life 
What do you hear 
A million words just trying to make 
The love song of the year 
Close your eyes but don't forget 
What you have heard 
A man who's trying to say three words 
The words that make me scared 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
And here I am 
Here I am
A million love songs later
Here I am

Looking to the future now 
This is what I see 
A million chances pass me by 
A million chances to hold you 
Take me back, take me back 
To where I used to be 
To hide away from all my truth 
Through the light I see 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
Here I am
Just for you girl
A million love songs later
Here I am
I feel for you, babe
Feel for you baby
A million love songs later
Here I, here I amBaby I'm watching you to see 
I don't like the way you've been treating me 
I promised you nothing and gave you much more 
Making love is all you wanted me for 

You're never satisfied, you're never satisfied 
If you open your mind you'll see 
That you could be satisfied with me 

Baby you criticize my every move 
Look, can't you see I've nothing to prove 
I've had enough, it's a matter of time 
Maybe we'll make it somewhere down the line 

You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 

I often wonder what I see in you 
You don't do the things that I want you to do 
I open my eyes and dream it's alright 
Maybe we'll make it together tonight
I'm tired of closing my eyes, to picture you in my mind 
It feels so cold to be alone 
Not sure where I want to be, so close to finding my dream 
We need to hold on to all the times we spoke of love 
Now I pray to God above that someday I can find the door 
I'm looking for 

I can make it, I know I can 
I can save this love forever 
I can make I know I can 
We can make this work together 

It's not a lonely men's dream,it's just that now that there's been 
A taste of love in my life 
That I refuse to return, I've got so much to learn 
How can it feels as though I've reached the top of this steep hill 
For a moment I was standing still 
Now I have the faith I've needed to believe 

'Cause you knop what this love means to me 
You know how it feels when I can see it in your face 
That you're missing me now, you feel I've let you down 
You've gotta hold on, you've gota reach out and believe 

I can make this world a place for me and you 
We can make it, we can make it together 
Do what you like, do what you like
Sugar sweet, if only they all knew 
Jam, can't spread no more you've took my bread 
Energy, just work, no rest or play 
Me, myself I'd rather be alone again 

So you can do what you like, do what you like 
No need to ask me, do what you want 
Do what you like, do what you like 
No need to tell me, do what you want 

Cherry pie, you're not as cute as me 
Ice, could never be as cold as you

Do what you like, do what you want
No need to ask me, do what you want
Do what you likeStanding back I can't believe
How you've led me on 
And judging by the things you say 
There's gotta be something wrong 
 
What you telling me that for you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
I wanna know 

Seems that I've been playing your game 
And how you think you've won 
But when you count up what you've gained you're the lonely one 

What you telling me that for when you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time (you're gonna promise me)
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
I'll never know

Promises, promises, promises
What you telling me that for when you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time

We've said goodbye, the taxi cab is waiting
Now don't you cry, just one more kiss
Before I have to go
Hey girl I know the situation changed
And so much is new but something in my life
Remains the same 'cause

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

The rumors true, you know that there've been others
What can I do, I tell you baby they don't mean a thing
Now girl don't go and throw our love away (throw our love away)
I'll be home soon back in your arms to hear you say that

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But I still love you
(Everything changes but you)
I'll spend every single day
Thinking about you

Though everything changes around us
(Baby don't you cry)
We will be the same as before forever more

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

(Everything changes but you)
I'll be thinking about you
Thinking about you
(Everything changes but you)
'Cause you know I love you
Know that I love you

(Everything changes but you)
I'll be thinking about you
Thinking about you
(Everything changes but you)
I love you
I love youWhen the time grew near, for me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for, hidin' from a word
I need to hear now, don't think I'll hear it again (Don't think I'll hear it again)

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (Woah)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Oh yeah)
All I do each night is think (Oh yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within (Closed the door)

If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

But the nights were always warm with you (My love)
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (All I do each night is pray)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Down on my knees)
All I do each night is think (Yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight (Woah)
Of the dream we long to live (We long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

All I do each night is pray (Come on, time is running out)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (You and me)
All I do each night is think, of all the times (On my knees, you and me)
I've closed the door to keep my love within (On my knees)
All I do each night is pray (You and me, forever more)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)You've maybe seen me walk behind you 
I follow you just everywhere you go 
I've heard a whisper, they're telling me you've missed her 
I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

Even now I know it doesn't change me 
Maybe someday you'll be free again 
Till then remember, babe I won't surrender 
Still hurts me when I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

You said you've been missing me 
But how can that be girl, how can that be girl 
Now all our plans that used to be passing us by 
You say I want to be freeHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (come on, yeah), your love is my only desire (I need your love)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need, I need your love

Yeah, you got to be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah)
Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah
Strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side (on the other side)
And I got hope (hope) in my soul, I'll keep walkin' baby
Keep on walkin' baby

Baby 
Don't you want me to go 
So honey, why don't you beg me to stay 
For love, and talk the way we used to talk 
'Til we both know what we've lost 
Never say the words we did before 
When it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No no, love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away
To a town called yesterday 
Love (love) ain't here anymore 

Listen, oh listen, I don't wanna let go 
So maybe we can change the way we feel 
For love, and open up the way we did before 
Now is the right time 
And I'm sure you'd never say the words you did before
Well, it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No, no love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away, to a town called yesterday 
Love (love) don't live here anymore (ooh no no no)

And when I find a place for me to keep my sweet love (keep my sweet love)
Then I will leave it there forever more, yeah 
And when I find someone to share I'll never give up 
I will hold you and believe that this life leads to more 

Oh, love 
No no no
No no no, well it was over
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore (it's gone away, it's gone away, to a town called yesterday)
Love ain't here anymore (don't you beg me to stay, no no no)
Love ain't here anymoreYou came to me, baby 
And I though that I saw love in your eyes 
But all the promises you made were not to be 
I should have seen through your disguise 

Oh no baby you know you always tried 
Make me look the fool, what's goin' on 
You used to be so good to me now what is wrong 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

What has happened to you lately 
I don't sense that lovin', feelin' anymore 
Every time you bring me down I want to cry 
Do you want to see me walkin' out that door 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Oh no baby you know you're always trying 
To make me look the fool 
Won't you tell me why you hurt me 
Is this the love has got to be 
No baby, I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for meI'm mad at you, because af all the things you do 
I want you to see the way your games are hurting me 
So why did I ever fall in love with you 
You're all of my nightmares and dreams come true 

What can I do to make you talk this problem through 
You said you've nothing to hide 
So let me hear your feelings inside 
I never dreamed that I'd see this kind of thing in my life 
So baby, please let me go, let me go 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

All I can see are staring eyes of mystery 
I've tried to look behind before you take my dignity and pride 
We sit and talk all night, still you never seem to lose your height 
You believe in yourself, I hope I'm never gonna need your help 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

You don't want me, you don't need me, I got news now 
'cause baby I'm watching you 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours tooDeceit and lies, is all I've taken 
Let me surface to breath 
No sacrifice, no inspiration 
Can you understand me? 

Why should I ask you, 
Why should I worry? 
You never worry about me 
Why should I ned you, 
Why don't I let you go? 
And let my heartaches run free 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 

What's on my mind, so many questions 
Though the answers I can guess 
You slip away shelter from confrontation 
Look my life is such a mess 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 
You hurt my mind, you hurt my soul 
Never believing what I'm saying 
I'll hunt you down, I'll make you mine 
You'll be the game I've started playing 
And if you won't be there I will know where you're going 
And if you won't be there I will try everyway of showing you that 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I need 

You understand, you realize 
The scene that I'm creating 
And all the while you compromise 
On the liberties I'm taking 
If you don't believe I want just you and I together 
Then you won't believe the dream of you and I forever because 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I needI am just one man with his one pair of eyes 
I dress in normal clothes and I don't try to disguise 
I'm looking out for love however it may seem 
I never do return in the always winning team 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heart 

I had my spills and thrills of love 
And held it in my hand 
I held on tight until it broke 
And I crashed to the ground 
Love cannot be on my side 
It's clearer every dull 
That every time I reach for love 
It always runs away 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heartIt's good to be near you, even though I'm alone 
Reviving memories of our happy home 
No sign of sunlight since you ran away 
These rooms get darker now every day 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

The consequences of freedom 
But now you have what you dreamed 
Just understand that things are not as they seem 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

I don't want to be lonely 
Because you're not there for me to be 
I don't want to be lonely 
I want to be loved 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me?I come to your door to see you again,
But where you once stood was an old man instead
I asked where you'd be, he said she's moved, on you see
All I have is a number you'd better ask her not me
So I picked up the phone and dialed your number
Not sure to put it down or speak
Then a voice I once knew answered in a sweet voice
She said hello then paused before I began to speak

Babe I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

You held your voice well, there were tears I could tell
But where were you now, was you gonna tell me in time?
Just give me a town and I'll be straight down
I've got so much to tell you about where I have been
As I walk down your road, can't wait to be near you
I can't keep the feeling in inside (I, I, I can't keep it inside)
As I stand at your door you answered in a sweet voice
You said hello then pause before I begin to speak

Babe (Babe), I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

As I looked away, I saw a face behind you
A little boy stood at your door
And as I looked again I saw his face was shining
He had my eyes (My eyes), he had my smile (my smile)

Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), please take me back (I'm back again)
Take me back (Babe)
Back here again
Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
Can't you see that I'm back again (Babe)
I'm here for you (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), just me and you (I'm back again)
You and me (Babe)
OohSure, so sure
Sure, so sure
Feel it, move it, feel it, move back
Need you so much, yeah, yeah
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

Sitting here runnin' to my lover (lover)
Last time we met, I wasn't to sure (not so sure)
Now I'm hoping, maybe dreaming, for a life as one
When she reads this I'm hoping she'll call (call me baby)
I need more much, more than before
I need positive reactions, whenever I'm down

'Cause I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking on my door
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

It's not a game, so don't play hard to get
Tired of running after you
There's no connections holding us down (down)
Isn't it a shame (shame), that it never happened (isn't it a shame), oh yeah
Though still here we are the second time round
It's gonna be social, compatible, sexual, irresistible
It's gotta be right for life

Now I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking at my door
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside, yeah
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found, yeah, yeah

Holdin', squeezin', touchin', teasin'
Wantin', wishin', waitin', thinkin'
Of your love, yeah yeah
Blindin', groovin', feel it, move it
Findin', breathin', bracin', breedin'

It's gotta be right for love

Sure, so sure, oh yeah

Sure, so sure, so sure that it's sweet love I foundI guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good

It's our Sunday through our Saturday love 
This ain't no weekend thing this ain't no teenage game 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

I have no reason to be feeling kind of strange 
But I guess that's just the man that I am 
In the clouds, in my dreams in pouring rain 
Hand in hand, under this rainbow we can always still the same 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday loveMaking my way through photographs 
Of the night when you first stood by my side 
Old friends with smiles some are here some are gone 
Good memories of our senior high 
Looking back we're the only couple still together 
Even then I knew this love would be forever, I knew 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

Our lives have all changed we've come a long long way 
Our faces show the lines of two young songs 
And in their houses there will be pictures 
Like the ones of you and me 
Hope they can look back and smile just like we have done 
Never once have I felt the need for another 
We were strong and survived the storm in time to discover 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

All of the smiles we have won 
Just from looking back and reliving all the good times 
And when we've been through all the pages 
We just start again, oh 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you
We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
Tudutu
We've had success (tudutu), we've had good times (tudutu)
But remember this (tudutu)

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there

With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realized what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I look so high you don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of "I can't explain this feeling" now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I made
The fact of reality (oh)

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for more
But remember this

We're not invincible, we're not invincible, no
We're only people, we're only people
Hey we're not invincible, we're not invincible
So again I tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, never forget where
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream (woah)
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing, oh baby
Never, no never, never forget for love
Someday, louder, louder, louder, louder loud

Oh (woah)
Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, louder now
Someday, come on, come on, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody (woah)Can we talk, thoughout the night I need you so bad 
And when we talk can you understand my feelings 
And understand it hurts to be without you 

Never prepared, never know what's going wrong 
I'm loosing though, I always thought this love was so strong 
So alone, so lost in the dark, 
So hurt, cause you will always have a place in my heart 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love, I need it 

Let's take a walk and reminisce about 
The feelings we used to feel 
Just stay the word and I'll be back for good my baby 
I'll be back to give you girl what you deserve 

Don't say too much, did I try to rule your life 
Did the love we had between us 
Miss the road to paradise 
Can we try again, can we chance it one more time 
Can the ecstasy we found here 
Be re-claimed as yours and mine 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your loveI kind of keep asking myself little questions 
Like where do I go from here 
I seem to keep loosing track of time and how long it's been 
Since I last had you near 

Been a painful road to a door that's closed 
Been a gamble that I knew I couldn't win 
Been a lonely conversation to this photograph of you 
In the mirror there's a sing I must give in 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you 

I used to enjoy spending my time on my own here 
Watching the jaded people pass 
Now here I am sharing their pain and their lonely tears 
And walking a road of broken glass 

It's a constant fight to get through each day and night 
It's a war between the present and the past 
And the face that's in your mind every time you close your eyes 
What's the reason, what's the answer, how long will this last 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 

Been a long time since I heard your last goobdye 
Still I hear it clearly every day and night 
What's the point in love when you have to give it up 
Yet still you need it and it's nowhere you can find 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you   
Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

This is the time I feel it 
Here in the middle of the night 
Still wide awake and feeling cheated 
From a girl I thought was treating me right 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

Gotta get away from the feelings I had 
Be real you won't be seeing her again 
It's complicated when you're feeling so bad 
And your girl is still walking away 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true Only one way to describe, this is deceit I am hiding 
Never been here before, never wanna see here again 
I've strayed from a long term lover 
And found greater lust from another 
My conscience is keeping me awake and shouting at me all night 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Being loved is a big responsibility, 
You can never give too much back 
You know it's so easy to walk away and leave that lady flat 
My life's feeling crowded with possessions, am I lucky or sad 
Is it time to turn away and lose everything I had 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Moving in circles, decisions chasing me round and round 
Why's life never easy, or do we make it hard for ourselves 
And when we find love we need to look for something new 
'Cos when it's all over, you always feel the need to be loved 
Like she always loved you 
If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt
Will we lose this chance again?
Strange roads with different signs
Don't even know where we divide
Are you my enemy or my friend?

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

We all grieve in different ways
If one tear could wash away the pain
We're all free to have the faith we believe, yeah
The world sleeps at different times
With one turn your day is now my night
We all live sharing the air that we breathe

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us throughJust have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
That any minute all the pain will stop

Just hold, me close
Inside, your arms, tonight
Don't be to hard on my emotions

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patience

I really wanna start over again
I know you wanna be my salvation
The one that I can always depend
I'll try to be strong, believe me
I'm trying to move on
It's complicated but understand me

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have little patience yeah
Have a little patience yeah

'Cause the scars run so deep
It's been hard, but I have to believe

Have a little patience
Have a little patience

Oh, 'cause I
I just need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I"m still healing
Just try
And have a little patience
Have a little patience
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patienceHere standing in the rain 
The sun has gone again and nothing's gonna change 
Time, I need a little time
As you slip out of sight 
And nothing heals the pain 

And I know that it's you
That's stopping me from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground
'Til I see you again
And you know

[Chorus]
The sun will shine, and we will see
There's nothing standing in our way 
Love will stand and never break 
I never thought this could be me 
Do you feel what I feel
Every time that you are near it's a beautiful world 
A beautiful world 

Words are hard to keep inside 
Even though I've tried, impossible to hide 
And you know that it's me
That's stopping you from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground 
'Til I see you again 
And you know

[Chorus]

I'll be the stars guiding you 
I'll be the place that you hide 
I'd run a thousand miles, a thousand miles
To be by your side

[Chorus]We've been many times before
Leaving rooms and slamming doors
We're climbing up the bedroom walls
Sometimes we make it so frustrating
I touch your mouth, I touch your lips
The answers are our fingertips
Not giving up or giving in
Why are we so complicated?

Oh tell me what to say, tell me
To make it all OK, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna see you hurting
Just hold on
Just hold on to me
I don't wanna see you crying
So hold on
So hold on to me

I'm trying to think of what to do
To really make it up to you
So many truths, too many lies
Making love can be so crazy
I find myself back here again
Asking you to let me in
You know it's time, we need to change
How can we live with all these maybes?

There are no words that say, no words
To make it go away

[Chorus]

Cause baby it's alright
I'm staying here tonight
So hold on

Just tell me what to say
To let you know
I'll always stayWhere, where are the stars?
The one that we used to call ours
Can't imagine it now
We used to laugh til we fell down

The secrets we had, now in the past
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

Now you're so far away
And I see our stars is fading
One too many times
Guess it just got tired of waiting around

The night that we thought, if these walls could talk
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you

So now does he give you love
Oh, Is it only me now that's thinking of, what we had and what we were
Oh, Did you ever care, baby was I ever there?

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
Tell me how, did we lose our way
It's hard to remember, all that we've shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone

There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

It's like I never loved you at all [Repeat: x2]You, you're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, so come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Stop (stop)
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile

Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, oh come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Hey, let me know ya (let me know ya)
You're all that matters to me (you're all that matters to me)
Hey, let me show ya (let me show ya)
You're all that matters to me (you're all that matters to me)

So come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Hey, let me know ya (let me know ya)
You're all that matters to me (you're all that matters to me)
Hey, let me show ya (let me show ya)
You're all that matters to me (you're all that matters)

Hey (let me love ya)

(Shine)
Oh come on (hey)
See the light on your face
(Oh, come on yeah)
Let it shine
Just let it shine
(Shine all your light over me)
ShineThere's a place we used to be
There's a face that I used to see
There's a picture with you by my side
There's a moment that I want to find.

I don't know where to start
Or how to begin
But I know I love you still.

If you ever turn away
If you ever change your mind
If the road ahead becomes too hard to climb
If there's something in your heart that tells you to stop
Oh to hold you close tonight
I'd wait for life.

There's a voice shouting inside my head
There's a space on your side of the bed
There's a hope every time there's a sound
There's a silence that's playing too loud

I don't know how you are
Or how you may be
But I know I love you still.

If I close my eyes
I'll dream a little deeper baby
Cause you are always on my mind
Yeah you are always on my mind
For life.I'm afraid of the morning
I'm afraid of the light
You should come with a warning
You should be wearing a sign
That says you're beautiful trouble
So you better beware
One look and I was in right over my head.

Oh this misery
There's no place on earth I'd rather be.

You're not the one I need
You're just the one that I want
Makes a perfect sense to me
You're not the one I need
But you're the one that I want
Ain't no sense of love.

I try to stop myself
So many times
But I keep falling over
I keep crossing the line
The heart of a gypsy and the soul of a stone
It's just a matter of time before you leave ma alone.

Oh sweet misery
Fill my heart up and pour it all over me.

It's not logical
That's the way I feel
It's not logical
Psychological
It's heaven underneath my skin but it's hell out here.What am I to you and what are you to me?
Are we getting better or did we used to be?
What of the song we used to sing?
Where are the souls we used to carry in?
What is a sail without hurricane?
What is a hurt without someone to blame?
Show me the sky and I'll climb the stairs
Give me something 'cause I'm losing it.

Give me what it is you believe in
Cause I give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay.

Tell me the word and I'll shout it out
For what is a voice when in doubt?
The world has changed
The world will change
Oh give me something cause I need to feel.

It's so good you know
I still love you so
And you don't have to do this on your own.
No, noWe used to walk Mancunian Way
We used to swagger we used to sway
Up until the lights took us away
Do you know what you meant to me?
We used to think we were the bomb
Then someone left a real one
We stayed indoors as the rain come
Back then it made no sense to me
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall they gave us the keys to the cit, but they don't fit anything
But I'm coming away.

I hear you calling
I came back running
Forgot that feeling
Been so log coming
They tried to stop her
She just got stronger
I'm driving home again
Back down Mancunian Way

I just forgot how it is to feel
To dance and move and keep it real
Been lying down foot ten long years
But I was there and it feels like yesterday
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall you came when I was pretty, but that don't work no more
But I'm coming anyway.

Now I stand here in front of you
I know now what I'm gonna do
My shoulders low, but my head is high
I'm gonna bring this town alive
Through this acidic rain
I'm gonna come back to life again.A little boy me went fishing in a wooden boat
Sitting there for hours in the cold
Patience is a virtue til we die
Then a ripple in the water caught my eye.

Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for
That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor
We go from green to blue to go to black
Breathe deep, who knows how long will this last.

Only was last week I learnt to drive
Stole my mother's keys and drove all night
Christine never showed it's 4 am
Started up mum's car drove home again.

One year ago I kissed my bride
Now I wait to hear my baby's cry
Woman showed me all that she knew then
To cut himself down man's born again.

Christine died and now I'm here alone
What I wouldn't give to be on that wooden boat.And the fishermen came back across the water 
And the people started running in the park 
And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms 
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us 
And the scent of burning oil was in the air 
And the music played 
And it felt so good to hear 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking 
As the tear from every cloud begin to fall 
For one moment then, we understood it all 

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming 
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women 
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter 
So come on, let me love you 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 
This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon 
A million people walking back to work 
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

You and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah, the gardenToday this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Let's make a new start
The future is ours to find
Can you see it, can you see it in my eyes
Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on (tonight)
Hold on
Hold on

Oh stay close to me (hold on)
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close me

Oh, hold your head high (hold on)
Arms open wide
Yea the world starts to come alive when you stay close it me

Today this could be the greatest day of our lives
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives

Oh and the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
Oh, oh, oh
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive) hold on
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive)
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me (hold on)
Oh (stay close to me) and the world comes alive
(Stay close to me) and the world
Watch the world come alive tonight
(Stay close to me) oh oh oh ohI'd watch the world go by in the morning
Lose myself in the the news
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I don't notice

I'd write a long love song with no meaning
And hope nobody would hear
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming

Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

I'd lock myself away in the evening
Afraid to ever come out
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings

Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh
HelloWhen the tears fall away
And there's no conversation
There's nothing left to break
That's not already broken
You're staring into space
And every inch of silence
Been standing here for days, and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

In the sudden light of day
The weight of expectation
Hurt begins to fade
As you find a new direction
Been talking here for days and days and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we said it all?Julie, what's your problem?
Won't you tell me, what's going on?
Cause there's a dark cloud, hanging over you.
You've been down, down, down too long.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside, and they're playing now, for you, for you.

Julie, come to your window.
Don't let your problems, spoil the view.
It's not a good thing, to cry today.
So come on change change change, come through the door.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now for you.
You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now for you, for you.

Why why why do you cry cry cry?
You should know by now that the sun comes up for you.
Why why why do you cry cry cry?
You should know now that the sun comes up for you, that the sun comes up for you.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now, for you, for you.
You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now, for you, for you.
Sha lalalalala I want you, sha lalalalala I do.Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And I'm going round in circles every day
The more I shout the more I hesitate
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Stand up please til I'm done losing my mind
And I've thanked you all just one too many times
The more we fall the harder we must climb
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Cause everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say, to say

Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And before the music takes you all away
I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to say

I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to sayJust the other day somebody said to me
"Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But jokes aside, I can explain
It's just my way of keeping track
With living on this planet now then

Have you turned on your TV
Have you seen reality
Have you seen a program that you've spent your whole life looking for
There's a girl in Camden town
Indecision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smile at me

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

All the noises and all these lights
All these talking through the nights
All these expectation now
It's making me neurotic
Tell me, have you seen your face before
I forgot to say 'hello'
Thought I'd make it clear now
That I've always been a smiler, tell me
 
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

Sometimes it's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody said to me
"Hey maybe you are oh so slightly OCD
A little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But, jokes aside, please stay with me
It's just my way of compartmentalizing all the things I see

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to thisSometimes I see your face looking at me
All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope I've got wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

I met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"
He met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe (oh maybe) I don't need you to save me (I don't need you to save me)
I just want you to help me (I just want you to help me)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night (Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you'll stayIs it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose to for my valentine? 
What is love? 

Is it only words? 
I'm trying to find? 
Or is it the way, that we're feeling now? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

A pain or a cure? 
A science of faith? 
A reason to fall to your knees and die? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

Only you can save me now. 
Only you can heal me now. 
Only you can show me now, 
What is love. 

Or is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
What is love?Take a piece of
me and throw the rest away (throw it all away)

My lips are moving but you don't hear a word I say (nothing left
to say)

Everybody loves a mystery, everybody needs a reason to believe
Everybody has a history, everybody's hiding something up their
...(sleeve)

sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at all
Play your little game, I'll look the other way (just look the
other way)

everybody wants the sunshine, everybody is a friend of mine
sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at all
Take a closer look inside, take a closer look inside
sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at allYou can dance if you like 
You can sing every line of every song 
No, you don't have to steal the show 
It was your show all along 

As the orchestra plays 
The people take the seats 
There's no room left in this house 
Its only you and me 
And if life is your stage 
I'll be watching 

[Chorus]
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
Ill be watching 
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
And I'll be watching you. 

Everything that you do 
As we start, rehearsing every scene 
The words to everything 
We realize that the crowd is listening 
And then the tears, fall down on your face 
In exactly the right place

[Chorus]Up and down 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see me down life's highway 

Not black or white 
As crystal clear as a cloudy night 
Traveling in the name of lonely 
I was only home when you held me 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to. 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear. 

Flying home tonight 
As far away as a satellite 
Keeping your heart in my pocket 
Hope to God that I don't drop it 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come bursting through my door 

And it's here, 

where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear 
I hear 

Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time to come home 
Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time 

Up and down, 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see my down life's highway 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to 
Is here 
All the things I keep so dear I hear 

Everybody's talking now 
Everybody's walking 'round 
Everybody's dreaming 'boutI'd watch the world go by in the morning
Lose myself in the the news
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I don't notice

I'd write a long love song with no meaning
And hope nobody would hear
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming

Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

I'd lock myself away in the evening
Afraid to ever come out
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings

Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh
HelloWhen the time grew near, for me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for, hidin' from a word
I need to hear now, don't think I'll hear it again (Don't think I'll hear it again)

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (Woah)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Oh yeah)
All I do each night is think (Oh yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within (Closed the door)

If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

But the nights were always warm with you (My love)
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (All I do each night is pray)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Down on my knees)
All I do each night is think (Yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight (Woah)
Of the dream we long to live (We long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

All I do each night is pray (Come on, time is running out)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (You and me)
All I do each night is think, of all the times (On my knees, you and me)
I've closed the door to keep my love within (On my knees)
All I do each night is pray (You and me, forever more)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong (whenever I'm wrong)
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back (want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good
Oh yeah

I guess now it's time that you came back for goodWe've come so far
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young
And we hope for more

We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
We've had success
We've had good times
But remember this

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there
With danger on my mind
I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realised what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I looked so high I don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of I can't explain this feeling now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I make
And the fact of reality

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far 
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young 
And we hope for more
But remember this
We're not invincible
We're not invincible, no (we're not invincible)
We're only people (ooh)
We're only people (we're not invincible)
Hey we're not invincible (we're not invincible)

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for moreHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

You can sing every line of every song 
No, you don't have to steal the show 
It was your show all along 

As the orchestra plays 
The people take the seats 
There's no room left in this house 
Its only you and me 
And if life is your stage 
I'll be watching 

[Chorus]
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
Ill be watching 
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
And I'll be watching you. 

Everything that you do 
As we start, rehearsing every scene 
The words to everything 
We realize that the crowd is listening 
And then the tears, fall down on your face 
In exactly the right place

[Chorus]Today this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Let's make a new start
The future is ours to find
Can you see it, can you see it in my eyes
Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

(Stay close to me) oh oh oh ohAnd the fishermen came back across the water 
And the people started running in the park 
And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms 
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us 
And the scent of burning oil was in the air 
And the music played 
And it felt so good to hear 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking 
As the tear from every cloud begin to fall 
For one moment then, we understood it all 

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming 
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women 
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter 
So come on, let me love you 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 
This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon 
A million people walking back to work 
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

You and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah, the gardenYou, you're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, so come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Stop (stop)
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile

Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, oh come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey

(Shine all your light over me)
ShineSometimes I see your face looking at me
All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope I've got wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

I met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"
He met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe (oh maybe) I don't need you to save me (I don't need you to save me)
I just want you to help me (I just want you to help me)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night (Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you'll stayJust the other day somebody said to me
"Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But jokes aside, I can explain
It's just my way of keeping track
With living on this planet now then

Have you turned on your TV
Have you seen reality
Have you seen a program that you've spent your whole life looking for
There's a girl in Camden town
Indecision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smile at me

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

All the noises and all these lights
All these talking through the nights
All these expectation now
It's making me neurotic
Tell me, have you seen your face before
I forgot to say 'hello'
Thought I'd make it clear now
That I've always been a smiler, tell me
 
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

Sometimes it's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody said to me
"Hey maybe you are oh so slightly OCD
A little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But, jokes aside, please stay with me
It's just my way of compartmentalizing all the things I see

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to thisSilence please 'cause I've got something to say
And I'm going round in circles every day
The more I shout the more I hesitate
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Stand up please til I'm done losing my mind
And I've thanked you all just one too many times
The more we fall the harder we must climb
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Cause everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say, to say

Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And before the music takes you all away
I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to say

I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to sayIs it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose to for my valentine? 
What is love? 

Is it only words? 
I'm trying to find? 
Or is it the way, that we're feeling now? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

A pain or a cure? 
A science of faith? 
A reason to fall to your knees and die? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

Only you can save me now. 
Only you can heal me now. 
Only you can show me now, 
What is love. 

Or is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
What is love?When the tears fall away
And there's no conversation
There's nothing left to break
That's not already broken
You're staring into space
And every inch of silence
Been standing here for days, and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

In the sudden light of day
The weight of expectation
Hurt begins to fade
As you find a new direction
Been talking here for days and days and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all

At the start of whatever,
Shouting love at the world.
Back then, we were like cavemen,
But we map the moon and the stars,
Then we forgave them.

We will meet you where the lights are,
The defenders, of the faith we are.
Where the thunder turns around
They'll run so hard we'll tear the ground away.

You know no one dies,
In these love drowned eyes,
Through our love drowned eyes,
We'll watch you sleep tonight.

Although no one understood
We were holding back the flood,
Learning how to dance the rain.
We were holding back the flood
They said we'd never dance again.

Bleeding, but none of us leaving,
Watch your mouth son or you'll find yourself floating home.
Here we come now on a dark star,
Seeing demons, not what we are.

Tiny minds and eager hands
Will try to strike but now will end today.

There's progress now where there once was none,
Where there once was none, then everything came along.

Although no one understood,
We were holding back the flood learning how to dance the rain.
There was more of them than us now they'll never dance again.

Although no one understood

Go tell Eve and go tell Adam
Liberate your sons and daughters
Some are gods and some are monsters
We'll get a five minute warning for divine intervention
With the satellites falling prepare for ascension

Under mind control
We'll be practicing our politics
Defending all our policies
Preparing for apocalypse
Don't let the hungry serpent see you no
No, no, no, no, no

She'll let you fall asleep then eat you whole
It's like a bullet to the head
It's an SOS, it's an S.O.S.,

It's an SOS, it's an S.O.S.,
Like a bullet in the head, it's an S.O.S.

When the levee breaks
And Manhattan sinks
There won't be water fit to drink
When the winter's warm
And the summer's cold
The poison stops you looking old

You'll get a five second warning for divine and intervention
And the satellites are falling prepare for ascension
As the earth looks on
The odds or probability
Of losing all capacity
To function it's hereditary
No antibiotic can save us now
No, no, no, no, no
We are the virus that we talk about

It's like a bullet to the head
It's an S.O.S., it's an S.O.S.,

Like a bullet in the head, it's an S.O.S.You're no angel, I'm no saint, if we were
We wouldn't be in this place tonight

Lost and lonely, scared and confused
We both have a past, nothing to lose, tonight
Well it cuts like a knife these bad luck blues
We both got scars from the hell we been through
Somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide

Reconnected, feelin' no pain
Seeking shelter like a spark in the rain, tonight (ooh yeah)
Worn and weathered, scared to go home
We're here together, but still all alone, tonight (uh uh yeah)
And there's no need to lie, we've both been abused
The love and the pain, the cocaine and booze, now
Most people don't, but some people do

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collideKings and Queens and Presidents
Ministers of Governments
Welcome to the future of your world

Through talking heads that took liberties
The monkeys learnt to build machines
They think they'll get to heaven through the universe

They say nothing
Deny everything
And make counter accusations

There's a surge in my psychosis every turn of the screw

I can see the world clearly but I have to squint.
I am a supersonic specimen.

The sky's too low and the room's too dark

But I, I've got a very big hope for us
I'm gonna keep looking up for us
It's been a difficult year
And I, I still wanna make love with you

We're not wise at all
It's getting harder, harder to recover
From the night before, when you turn me on
But I, I like to think of us moving on
I like to think of us getting on

Until we move into reverse,
Can feel the pressure and all the minds,
And the whole Universe.
Is it a question of force,
And a physical law,
We've had this battle a thousand times,
Never been here before,
Never been here before.

Haven't got the strength to fight anymore,
Got no desire to die anymore,

I want to see you again, again, again,
Haven't got the strength to fight anymore,
Don't even know what I'm fighting forWe became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned
Expendable soldiers smiling at anything
Raised on a feeling our lives would have meaning eventually

We were once the answer and then you discover
You're actually just one thing after another
And what was the question and why was the lesson so deafening?

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And outside forces didn't make it easy
So I thought I'd go before you leave me
Self-preservation was no explanation for anything

But the truth is more than we'll ever comprehend
I'm just starting to understand, my friend
All of that distance, 'cause I fell in love with the enemy

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say

Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:

At last, we meet on no man's land
Just footprints in the sand
We meet on no man's land, at last

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

One meaning
Just one meaningDarling please forgive me
I was sitting on the fence
I was slowly going out of head
I did not hear a word that you said
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbed

If I could take your blows, If I could get pass go,
If I could find a way of fixing the things that I broke
Then I would, if I could
And I might understand now I ended outta mind
And I might understand now I ended outta mind

But the truth is hard to find
When it's playing tricks with your mind
Darling please forgive me
I was hanging with my friends
I was slowly getting outta my head
I did not hear a word that you said
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbed
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbedStanding, on the edge of forever,
At the start of whatever,
Shouting love at the world.
Back then, we were like cavemen,
But we map the moon and the stars,
Then we forgave them.

We will meet you where the lights are,
The defenders, of the faith we are.
Where the thunder turns around 
They'll run so hard we'll tear the ground away.

You know no one dies, 
In these love drowned eyes,
Through our love drowned eyes, 
We'll watch you sleep tonight.

Although no one understood 
We were holding back the flood,
Learning how to dance the rain.
We were holding back the flood 
They said we'd never dance again.

Bleeding, but none of us leaving,
Watch your mouth son or you'll find yourself floating home.
Here we come now on a dark star, 
Seeing demons, not what we are.

Tiny minds and eager hands 
Will try to strike but now will end today.

There's progress now where there once was none, 
Where there once was none, then everything came along.

Although no one understood, 
We were holding back the flood learning how to dance the rain.
There was more of them than us now they'll never dance again.

Although no one understood

Although no one understood, 
There was more of them than us learning how to dance the rain.
(learning how to dance the rain)
There was more of them than us now they'll never dance again.

Now we'll never dance again.

Oh ah, 
Oh ah, 
Oh ah, 
Oh ah,
Oh ah, 
Oh ah, 
Oh ahSave our souls we're splitting atoms
Go tell Eve and go tell Adam
Liberate your sons and daughters
Some are gods and some are monsters
We'll get a five minute warning for divine intervention
With the satellites falling prepare for ascension

Under mind control
We'll be practicing our politics
Defending all our policies
Preparing for apocalypse
Don't let the hungry serpent see you no
No, no, no, no, no

She'll let you fall asleep then eat you whole
It's like a bullet to the head
It's an SOS, it's an S.O.S.,
Oh yes, oh yes, it's an S.O.S.
It's an SOS, it's an S.O.S.,
Like a bullet in the head, it's an S.O.S.

When the levee breaks
And Manhattan sinks
There won't be water fit to drink
When the winter's warm
And the summer's cold
The poison stops you looking old

You'll get a five second warning for divine and intervention
And the satellites are falling prepare for ascension
As the earth looks on
The odds or probability
Of losing all capacity
To function it's hereditary
No antibiotic can save us now
No, no, no, no, no
We are the virus that we talk about

It's like a bullet to the head
It's an S.O.S., it's an S.O.S.,
Oh yes, oh yes, it's an S.O.S.
It's an S.O.S., it's an S.O.S.,
Like a bullet in the head, it's an S.O.S.
It's an S.O.S. it's an S.O.S.,
Oh yes, oh yes, it's an S.O.S.
It's an S.O.S., it's an S.O.S.,
Like a bullet in the head, it's an S.O.S.

Like a bullet in my head
Like a bullet in my head
It's an S.O.S., it's an S.O.S.,
Oh yes, oh yes, it's an S.O.S.
It's an S.O.S., it's an S.O.S.,
Like a bullet in the head, it's an S.O.S.
It's an S.O.S. it's an S.O.S.,
Oh yes, oh yes, it's an SOS
It's an S.O.S., it's an S.O.S.,
Like a bullet in the head, it's an S.O.S.You're no angel, I'm no saint, if we were
We wouldn't be in this place tonight

Lost and lonely, scared and confused
We both have a past, nothing to lose, tonight
Well it cuts like a knife these bad luck blues
We both got scars from the hell we been through
Somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide

Reconnected, feelin' no pain
Seeking shelter like a spark in the rain, tonight (ooh yeah)
Worn and weathered, scared to go home
We're here together, but still all alone, tonight (uh uh yeah)
And there's no need to lie, we've both been abused
The love and the pain, the cocaine and booze, now
Most people don't, but some people do

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collideKings and Queens and Presidents
Ministers of Governments
Welcome to the future of your world

Through talking heads that took liberties
The monkeys learnt to build machines
They think they'll get to heaven through the universe

They say nothing
Deny everything
And make counter accusations
My friends, my dear, my love, my God

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all?
The Good, the Bad, the Ugly or the Beautiful

Because it's up hill and against the wind
With no-one there to let us in
Leave your thoughts and save yourself you fool

The daggers of science
Evolving into violence
We're not sure where the fallout blows
But we all know ·

Just footprints in the sand
We meet on no man's land, at last

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

One meaning
Just one meaningWhen we were young the world seemed so old
Careless and cold
We did what we were told in our lives
When we were young
Had the world by the tail
Good would prevail
Starships at sail
And none of us would fail in this life
Not when you're young

We were drawn to whoever could keep us together
And bound by the heavens above
And we tried to survive traveling at the speed of love

Woah when we were young
When we adored the fabulous
Woah when we were young
We were the foolish fearless
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
Woah when we were young

In a moment of grace
A long leap of faith
The still more glorious dawn awaits
It's my life
I'm here with the lovers

And we burned the bridges
We're crossing over
Just to see the firelight
And the innocent are getting over
Being old tonight

Woah when we were young
When everything was what it seemed
Woah when we were young
And everyday was how we dreamed
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
Woah when we were young

And when you look at yourself tonight
Are you someone you recognize?
You can take back what you've given away
But it must be the last time

Woah when we were young
Woah when we were young
When we were young

Woah when we were young
When we adored the fabulous
Woah when we were young
We were the foolish fearless
Woah when we were young
We didn't know it wouldn't last
Woah when we were youngMan

The work is done
A place for everything til everything is in its place
And every setting sun
When the work was done
Was a day that didn't go to waste
When all the work is done
It will be done
Producing everything for everything to be replaced
And in dirty towns we will settle down
Manufacture for the human race

The greatest story that was ever told in the lights of history
Was the grand designs of other men
And they built those walls for you and me

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men
Don't start thinking with your heart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men

When the work is done, the work is done
We'll bebionic and beyond the circuits of our minds
We'll get nothing done under electric sun
Leave the weight of labor far behind

We're the greatest story that was ever told
But we don't know where we're from
And the walls became but a memory
Of the days when all the work begun

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men

Rejoice the day, the day the work is done
Rejoice the day, the day the work is done

Everybody's counting hours
Everybody's counting hours

Til the day the work is done
Til the day the work is done

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men

Rejoice the day,the day the work is done
Rejoice the day, the day the work is done

Everybody's counting hours
Everybody's counting hoursLet all that's simple pass you by
Let all that lives be free to die
We're all, we're all key to life
Face all that rage and history
It makes no sense to you and me
We're all, we're all free to fight
I broke all my vows, my common sense
Says find vocation somewhere else

This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
Tonight

Lay all that's sinful down to rest
May all our judgments be confessed
We're all, we're all guilty now
Drink for the crowd not for yourself
Til someone hears your cry for help
Let's all, let's all take a bow
I spent all my mind on making sense
It made no difference in the end
This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
Tonight

I close my eyes and I am somebody else
Tonight I close my eyes and I don't need any help
Every moment of laughter
Every moment I fear
Every moment that you're not here

This should've been so beautiful, so beautiful, be so beautiful
This should have been so beautiful, been so beautiful

This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
TonightDon't stay where you are not loved
Those people obscure the view
But if I've done my job
They won't wanna mess with you

Finding some romances
A place where you exist
Live with your mother' smile
But see you through daddy's eyes

You might lose your dignity
But it's not what it used to be

And don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like kings and queens
I'll be the first, the last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to me

Just listen to your heart
Not the voices in your head
Forget how it'd made you feel
But don't forget what was said

Tears are words than we can touch
When words only say so much
Look out? what you've got
Then you'll always have enough

You might lose your dignity
But look what its done for me

And don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like kings and queens
I'll be the first, the last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to me

And don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like kings and queens
I'll be the first, the last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to meAlien Alien Alien Alien Alien Alien Alien Alien

Through the carnage of the crash
Baby I'm with you
And the photos in a flash
Baby I'm with you
Through violent seas
Baby I'm with you
Until release
Baby I'm with you
And all the animals in the park
Are waiting for their dinner to come
And all the creatures in the dark
Are waiting for the light to come on

We are the aliens,we are, we are, we are alien
God loves the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
All the animals in the park, alien
And all the strangers that wake up in the dark
Are waiting for the light to come on

Through electronic desire

AlienWhat a wonderful world this is
What a wonderful world this is
It makes me want to kiss
What a beautiful kiss this is
What a beautiful kiss of life
Just before I die
I've been spending time
I've been losing time

Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet
All those minutes get lost in time
One step forward two steps behind
So before I think myself too deep
What a wonderful world this is
What a wonderful world this is
What a delicate tale of bliss
That I don't want to miss
In this moment where we all exist
On the precipice of the abyss
It always was, how it is
Spending time, wasting time
I've been spending time, I've been wasting time

Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet
All those minutes get lost in time
One step forward two steps behind
So before I think myself too deep
What a wonderful world this is

No time
Am I losing my mind
No time
Am I losing my mind
There's no time for us, no time for us until we're out of time (we're
Running out of time)
There's no time for us, no time
What a wonderful world this is
There's no time for us, no time (we're running out of time)
(Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keepOh I can see the future
Coming to you
Crying with the sadness in your eyes
And I can find a faith in years I've wasted
Being around enough to feel alive
And when the world is broken, hurt and colder
No one ever knows the reason why
For the ones we may become
For the balance we have won
For the day we wish the sun
Gonna play it loud tonight

When you dream of a dream
And you live in the world
Every hope is a hope
For the best don't want you resting my bones
And you're calling me now
I will see you all the time
Should be out there living the life
And not just watching you

Take me back
Before we all explode
Before we turn to stone
Before the light is gone
Take me back
To where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before the day goes off

Tonight we gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight, we'll remember
We'll remember these days

What a day to believe
To believe in the night
Want a date to belong, to a face in the crowd to the beat of your heart
And the moment begin
And you're working it out
And you're holding us all
In your hands, don't want you waiting for

Take me back
Before we lose control
Before the tables turn
Before we break it off
Take me back
To where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before they take us off

Tonight we gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight, we'll remember
We'll remember these days

Oh I can see the future
Coming to you
Crying with the sadness in your eyes
And I can find a faith in years I've wasted
Being around enough to feel alive
And when the world is broken, hurt and colder
No one ever knows the reason why

For the balance we have won
For the day we wish the sun

And crack the combination all on your own

Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life?
Do you really love life?
Do you really love life? 
Do you really love life?

Hard up, cut me up
Good day, out of luck
My bones set in stone
Dear Lord, take me home
Crowd surf, out of bounds
Drink till we're falling down
Made up that you came
Big dreams till the end
Some say we came out of the sea 
Long time ago it's true
I come out of the ocean
To make my peace with you
I'm only fighting for you girl
I'm only fighting for the world
Before they bring me down
Out of Heaven to the ground 

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life?
Do you really love life?

Forward, sweep me up
High tide, good enough
Sad face, when we're low
Always, step to the right
Amen, ready made
Bad dreams, out again
Fireworks, good to know
Today's the start of the weekend

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life?

Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life?Life slow down
You've gone too fast
And words begin to mean a little less

Bones stay strong
Cause the road ahead is long
And every voice will miss us when we're gone

You're free to come alive
You're free to come tonightI used to be broken
Stuck in a cage
I used to be low down
I couldn't be saved
Now I feel like a lion
That cannot be tamed
'Cause you brought me back to life, to life again

I was fearless but so easily
I let life fade away the colour of my dreams
Now you're with me, I know I can be
Higher, higher than higher

(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be on the ground
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be out of my mind
Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be lost in the fire
If you weren't, you weren't here
Couldn't open up my eyes
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)

The sky is a long way
When covered in rain
You gave me my vision
You gave me my faith
And now I'm a fighter
I found the flame
You set me alight, alight again

I was fearless but so easily
I let life fade away the colour of my dreams
Now you're with me, I know I can be
Higher, higher than higher

(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be on the ground
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be out of my mind
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be lost in the fire
If you weren't, you weren't here
Couldn't open up my eyes
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)

Just one way for us nowOh there are people here
So many people here looking back at me
Feel the energy
Oh they call my name
Oh they call my name it's the loudest noise
And it's all for me

Yeah it's all for me
Yeah when it's all for me
I can get away to a better place
Hey I'm looking down
Yeah I'm looking down
I can see you now
Are you coming out

There's a voice in my head
And it's talking again
Out of time, out of space
It's a feeling a meaning that I can taste

I don't know what people see but I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
I don't know why people give but I'll take it (I'll take it), I'll take it (I'll take it)

Someone that they can adore
Give them what they came here for
Always leave them wanting more

And a little bit of conversation
With a head full of hope
And a bit of your self belief
Is it asking too much to
Rely on your imagination
Am I asking too much
To remain in your company
Stop everything

We can stay here if you hold still
We can stay here for life if you say you will
We'll be caught in a moment of time
If we all freeze...
Don't even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won't leave
Freeze

With the flicker of a promise
And in view of our situation
I think you should know
That I never wanted this to change
And you're free to say whatever you want to
But whatever you want, whatever you want
Don't change
Please don't change

We can stay here if you hold still
We can stay here for life if you say you will
We'll be caught in a moment of time
If we all freeze...
Don't even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won't leave

The words, the words we never say
Don't make a sound till it's too late
Just freeze so we don't have to start again
Before we make the same mistakes
Before we throw it all away
The words, the words we never say
Don't make a sound till it's too late
Just freeze so we don't have to start again
Before we make the same mistakes

Don't even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won't leave

Didn't stop, all this space
It makes me want to see your face
Such a beautiful place
When I met you last I was at a loss
Life goes on
Breakin' hard into the ground
It was you that I found

I can run if you are callin'
I can fly if you are fallin'
I can break through every wall they build for me
I can see the sun is risin'
I can see your eyes are smilin'
I will hold onto the things that I believe
Believe

Shut my eyes I feel alive
Hold me back
In our hearts, we'll wear the scars
Of the wilderness years
Give me one more night at last
Filled with joy
When your guard is down
And you're hand in hand
Will you understand how lucky we are
It's been a very long day

I can run if you are callin'
I can fly if you are fallin'
I can break through every wall they build for me
I can see the sun is risin'
I can see your eyes are smilin'
I will hold onto the things that I believe

If you heard her voice calling your name you'd never be the same
Nothing was new and nowhere was safe and sound
And then she arrived, oh just in time to save this heart of mine
Oh, I'd waited all my life

All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My head's in the clouds I'm no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing

Maybe she knows, and maybe she'll soon be mine
In a perfect world, you know that this girl would be right here tonight
Weighing heavy on my mind

All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My head's in the clouds I'm no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing

Maybe my heart and my head are colliding
Or maybe it's more than I dare to believe
Don't ever let me forget what I'm feeling
Or wake up to find that it's all just a dream

All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My head's in the clouds that I'm no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazingGive me your hurt if you need someone to blame
Give me your call if you need someone to save
I'll take the salt and all the weight of your tears
All of your fears I'm gonna take them away
Take them away

By the beauty of your timing
And those endless acts of kindness

I want to give you more, give you more
I only want to let you know

And return to be discovered

If you get a flu attack 
For thirty days you're on your back 
Doing not a single dance

Oh yeah
Put your head against my life 
What do you hear 
A million words just trying to make 
The love song of the year 
Close your eyes but don't forget 
What you have heard 
A man who's trying to say three words 
The words that make me scared 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
And here I am 
Here I am
A million love songs later
Here I am

Looking to the future now 
This is what I see 
A million chances pass me by 
A million chances to hold you 
Take me back, take me back 
To where I used to be 
To hide away from all my truth 
Through the light I see 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
Here I am
Just for you girl
A million love songs later
Here I am
I feel for you, babe
Feel for you baby
A million love songs later
Here I, here I amBaby I'm watching you to see 
I don't like the way you've been treating me 
I promised you nothing and gave you much more 
Making love is all you wanted me for 

You're never satisfied, you're never satisfied 
If you open your mind you'll see 
That you could be satisfied with me 

Baby you criticize my every move 
Look, can't you see I've nothing to prove 
I've had enough, it's a matter of time 
Maybe we'll make it somewhere down the line 

You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 

I often wonder what I see in you 
You don't do the things that I want you to do 
I open my eyes and dream it's alright 
Maybe we'll make it together tonight
I'm tired of closing my eyes, to picture you in my mind 
It feels so cold to be alone 
Not sure where I want to be, so close to finding my dream 
We need to hold on to all the times we spoke of love 
Now I pray to God above that someday I can find the door 
I'm looking for 

I can make it, I know I can 
I can save this love forever 
I can make I know I can 
We can make this work together 

It's not a lonely men's dream,it's just that now that there's been 
A taste of love in my life 
That I refuse to return, I've got so much to learn 
How can it feels as though I've reached the top of this steep hill 
For a moment I was standing still 
Now I have the faith I've needed to believe 

'Cause you knop what this love means to me 
You know how it feels when I can see it in your face 
That you're missing me now, you feel I've let you down 
You've gotta hold on, you've gota reach out and believe 

I can make this world a place for me and you 
We can make it, we can make it together 
Do what you like, do what you like
Sugar sweet, if only they all knew 
Jam, can't spread no more you've took my bread

No need to tell me, do what you want

Do what you likeStanding back I can't believe
How you've led me on 
And judging by the things you say 
There's gotta be something wrong 
 
What you telling me that for you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
I wanna know 

Seems that I've been playing your game 
And how you think you've won 
But when you count up what you've gained you're the lonely one 

What you telling me that for when you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time (you're gonna promise me)

We've said goodbye, the taxi cab is waiting
Now don't you cry, just one more kiss
Before I have to go
Hey girl I know the situation changed
And so much is new but something in my life
Remains the same 'cause

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

The rumors true, you know that there've been others
What can I do, I tell you baby they don't mean a thing
Now girl don't go and throw our love away (throw our love away)
I'll be home soon back in your arms to hear you say that

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But I still love you
(Everything changes but you)
I'll spend every single day
Thinking about you

Though everything changes around us
(Baby don't you cry)
We will be the same as before forever more

(Everything changes but you)
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
(Everything changes but you)
You know every single day
I'll be thinking about you

(Everything changes but you)
I'll be thinking about you
Thinking about you
(Everything changes but you)
'Cause you know I love you
Know that I love you

(Everything changes but you)
I'll be thinking about you
Thinking about you
(Everything changes but you)
I love you
I love youWhen the time grew near, for me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for, hidin' from a word
I need to hear now, don't think I'll hear it again (Don't think I'll hear it again)

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (Woah)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Oh yeah)
All I do each night is think (Oh yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within (Closed the door)

If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

But the nights were always warm with you (My love)
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (All I do each night is pray)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Down on my knees)
All I do each night is think (Yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight (Woah)
Of the dream we long to live (We long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

All I do each night is pray (Come on, time is running out)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (You and me)
All I do each night is think, of all the times (On my knees, you and me)
I've closed the door to keep my love within (On my knees)
All I do each night is pray (You and me, forever more)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)You've maybe seen me walk behind you 
I follow you just everywhere you go 
I've heard a whisper, they're telling me you've missed her 
I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

Even now I know it doesn't change me 
Maybe someday you'll be free again 
Till then remember, babe I won't surrender 
Still hurts me when I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

You said you've been missing me 
But how can that be girl, how can that be girl 
Now all our plans that used to be passing us by 
You say I want to be freeHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (come on, yeah), your love is my only desire (I need your love)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need, I need your love

Yeah, you got to be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah)
Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah
Strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side (on the other side)
And I got hope (hope) in my soul, I'll keep walkin' baby
Keep on walkin' baby

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire (only desire)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Baby 
Don't you want me to go 
So honey, why don't you beg me to stay 
For love, and talk the way we used to talk 
'Til we both know what we've lost 
Never say the words we did before 
When it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No no, love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away
To a town called yesterday 
Love (love) ain't here anymore 

Listen, oh listen, I don't wanna let go 
So maybe we can change the way we feel 
For love, and open up the way we did before 
Now is the right time 
And I'm sure you'd never say the words you did before
Well, it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No, no love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away, to a town called yesterday 
Love (love) don't live here anymore (ooh no no no)

And when I find a place for me to keep my sweet love (keep my sweet love)
Then I will leave it there forever more, yeah 
And when I find someone to share I'll never give up 
I will hold you and believe that this life leads to more 

Oh, love 
No no no
No no no, well it was over
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore (it's gone away, it's gone away, to a town called yesterday)
Love ain't here anymore (don't you beg me to stay, no no no)
Love ain't here anymoreYou came to me, baby 
And I though that I saw love in your eyes 
But all the promises you made were not to be 
I should have seen through your disguise 

Oh no baby you know you always tried 
Make me look the fool, what's goin' on 
You used to be so good to me now what is wrong 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

What has happened to you lately 
I don't sense that lovin', feelin' anymore 
Every time you bring me down I want to cry 
Do you want to see me walkin' out that door 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Oh no baby you know you're always trying 
To make me look the fool 
Won't you tell me why you hurt me 
Is this the love has got to be 
No baby, I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for meI'm mad at you, because af all the things you do 
I want you to see the way your games are hurting me 
So why did I ever fall in love with you 
You're all of my nightmares and dreams come true 

What can I do to make you talk this problem through 
You said you've nothing to hide 
So let me hear your feelings inside 
I never dreamed that I'd see this kind of thing in my life 
So baby, please let me go, let me go 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

All I can see are staring eyes of mystery 
I've tried to look behind before you take my dignity and pride 
We sit and talk all night, still you never seem to lose your height 
You believe in yourself, I hope I'm never gonna need your help 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

You don't want me, you don't need me, I got news now 
'cause baby I'm watching you 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours tooDeceit and lies, is all I've taken 
Let me surface to breath 
No sacrifice, no inspiration 
Can you understand me? 

Why should I ask you, 
Why should I worry? 
You never worry about me 
Why should I ned you, 
Why don't I let you go? 
And let my heartaches run free 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 

What's on my mind, so many questions 
Though the answers I can guess 
You slip away shelter from confrontation 
Look my life is such a mess 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 
You hurt my mind, you hurt my soul 
Never believing what I'm saying 
I'll hunt you down, I'll make you mine 
You'll be the game I've started playing 
And if you won't be there I will know where you're going 
And if you won't be there I will try everyway of showing you that 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I need 

You understand, you realize 
The scene that I'm creating 
And all the while you compromise 
On the liberties I'm taking 
If you don't believe I want just you and I together 
Then you won't believe the dream of you and I forever because 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I needI am just one man with his one pair of eyes 
I dress in normal clothes and I don't try to disguise 
I'm looking out for love however it may seem 
I never do return in the always winning team 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heart 

I had my spills and thrills of love 
And held it in my hand 
I held on tight until it broke 
And I crashed to the ground 
Love cannot be on my side 
It's clearer every dull 
That every time I reach for love 
It always runs away 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heartIt's good to be near you, even though I'm alone 
Reviving memories of our happy home 
No sign of sunlight since you ran away 
These rooms get darker now every day 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

The consequences of freedom 
But now you have what you dreamed 
Just understand that things are not as they seem 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

I don't want to be lonely 
Because you're not there for me to be 
I don't want to be lonely 
I want to be loved 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me?I come to your door to see you again,
But where you once stood was an old man instead
I asked where you'd be, he said she's moved, on you see
All I have is a number you'd better ask her not me
So I picked up the phone and dialed your number
Not sure to put it down or speak
Then a voice I once knew answered in a sweet voice
She said hello then paused before I began to speak

Babe I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

You held your voice well, there were tears I could tell
But where were you now, was you gonna tell me in time?
Just give me a town and I'll be straight down
I've got so much to tell you about where I have been
As I walk down your road, can't wait to be near you
I can't keep the feeling in inside (I, I, I can't keep it inside)
As I stand at your door you answered in a sweet voice
You said hello then pause before I begin to speak

Babe (Babe), I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

As I looked away, I saw a face behind you
A little boy stood at your door
And as I looked again I saw his face was shining
He had my eyes (My eyes), he had my smile (my smile)

Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), please take me back (I'm back again)
Take me back (Babe)
Back here again
Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
Can't you see that I'm back again (Babe)
I'm here for you (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), just me and you (I'm back again)
You and me (Babe)

Sitting here runnin' to my lover (lover)
Last time we met, I wasn't to sure (not so sure)
Now I'm hoping, maybe dreaming, for a life as one
When she reads this I'm hoping she'll call (call me baby)

'Cause I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking on my door

Tired of running after you
There's no connections holding us down (down)
Isn't it a shame (shame), that it never happened (isn't it a shame), oh yeah

Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good

How much longer 'til I walk you through that door? 
Don't hold back the feeling we all know lies deep inside 
It won't be long now till your heart is open wide 
I need you, I need you, I need you you you you you 
Get the message now, I've got to have you girl 

Every guy needs a girl like you, 
Every girl needs a guy like me 
Every guy needs a guy like you 
See cause that's how it's meant to beMonday morning and the feeling's still the same 
It's our Sunday through our Saturday love 
This ain't no weekend thing this ain't no teenage game 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

I have no reason to be feeling kind of strange 
But I guess that's just the man that I am 
In the clouds, in my dreams in pouring rain 
Hand in hand, under this rainbow we can always still the same 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday loveMaking my way through photographs 
Of the night when you first stood by my side 
Old friends with smiles some are here some are gone 
Good memories of our senior high 
Looking back we're the only couple still together 
Even then I knew this love would be forever, I knew 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

Our lives have all changed we've come a long long way 
Our faces show the lines of two young songs 
And in their houses there will be pictures 
Like the ones of you and me 
Hope they can look back and smile just like we have done 
Never once have I felt the need for another 
We were strong and survived the storm in time to discover 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

All of the smiles we have won 
Just from looking back and reliving all the good times 
And when we've been through all the pages 
We just start again, oh 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you
We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
Tudutu
We've had success (tudutu), we've had good times (tudutu)
But remember this (tudutu)

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there

With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realized what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I look so high you don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of "I can't explain this feeling" now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I made
The fact of reality (oh)

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for more
But remember this

We're not invincible, we're not invincible, no
We're only people, we're only people
Hey we're not invincible, we're not invincible
So again I tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, never forget where
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream (woah)
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing, oh baby
Never, no never, never forget for love
Someday, louder, louder, louder, louder loud

Oh (woah)
Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, louder now
Someday, come on, come on, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody (woah)Can we talk, thoughout the night I need you so bad 
And when we talk can you understand my feelings 
And understand it hurts to be without you 

Never prepared, never know what's going wrong 
I'm loosing though, I always thought this love was so strong 
So alone, so lost in the dark, 
So hurt, cause you will always have a place in my heart 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love, I need it 

Let's take a walk and reminisce about 
The feelings we used to feel 
Just stay the word and I'll be back for good my baby 
I'll be back to give you girl what you deserve 

Don't say too much, did I try to rule your life 
Did the love we had between us 
Miss the road to paradise 
Can we try again, can we chance it one more time 
Can the ecstasy we found here 
Be re-claimed as yours and mine 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your loveI kind of keep asking myself little questions 
Like where do I go from here 
I seem to keep loosing track of time and how long it's been 
Since I last had you near 

Been a painful road to a door that's closed 
Been a gamble that I knew I couldn't win 
Been a lonely conversation to this photograph of you 
In the mirror there's a sing I must give in 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you 

I used to enjoy spending my time on my own here 
Watching the jaded people pass 
Now here I am sharing their pain and their lonely tears 
And walking a road of broken glass 

It's a constant fight to get through each day and night 
It's a war between the present and the past 
And the face that's in your mind every time you close your eyes 
What's the reason, what's the answer, how long will this last 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 

Been a long time since I heard your last goobdye 
Still I hear it clearly every day and night 
What's the point in love when you have to give it up 
Yet still you need it and it's nowhere you can find 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you   
Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

This is the time I feel it 
Here in the middle of the night 
Still wide awake and feeling cheated 
From a girl I thought was treating me right 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

Gotta get away from the feelings I had 
Be real you won't be seeing her again 
It's complicated when you're feeling so bad 
And your girl is still walking away 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true Only one way to describe, this is deceit I am hiding 
Never been here before, never wanna see here again 
I've strayed from a long term lover 
And found greater lust from another 
My conscience is keeping me awake and shouting at me all night 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Being loved is a big responsibility, 
You can never give too much back 
You know it's so easy to walk away and leave that lady flat 
My life's feeling crowded with possessions, am I lucky or sad 
Is it time to turn away and lose everything I had 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Moving in circles, decisions chasing me round and round 
Why's life never easy, or do we make it hard for ourselves 
And when we find love we need to look for something new 
'Cos when it's all over, you always feel the need to be loved 
Like she always loved you 
If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt
Will we lose this chance again?
Strange roads with different signs
Don't even know where we divide
Are you my enemy or my friend?

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

We all grieve in different ways
If one tear could wash away the pain
We're all free to have the faith we believe, yeah
The world sleeps at different times
With one turn your day is now my night
We all live sharing the air that we breathe

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us throughJust have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
That any minute all the pain will stop

Just hold, me close
Inside, your arms, tonight
Don't be to hard on my emotions

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patience

I really wanna start over again
I know you wanna be my salvation
The one that I can always depend
I'll try to be strong, believe me
I'm trying to move on
It's complicated but understand me

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have little patience yeah
Have a little patience yeah

'Cause the scars run so deep
It's been hard, but I have to believe

Have a little patience
Have a little patience

Oh, 'cause I
I just need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I"m still healing
Just try
And have a little patience
Have a little patience
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patienceHere standing in the rain 
The sun has gone again and nothing's gonna change 
Time, I need a little time
As you slip out of sight 
And nothing heals the pain 

And I know that it's you
That's stopping me from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground
'Til I see you again
And you know

[Chorus]
The sun will shine, and we will see
There's nothing standing in our way 
Love will stand and never break 
I never thought this could be me 
Do you feel what I feel
Every time that you are near it's a beautiful world 
A beautiful world 

Words are hard to keep inside 
Even though I've tried, impossible to hide 
And you know that it's me
That's stopping you from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground 
'Til I see you again 
And you know

[Chorus]

I'll be the stars guiding you 
I'll be the place that you hide 
I'd run a thousand miles, a thousand miles
To be by your side

[Chorus]We've been many times before
Leaving rooms and slamming doors
We're climbing up the bedroom walls
Sometimes we make it so frustrating
I touch your mouth, I touch your lips
The answers are our fingertips
Not giving up or giving in
Why are we so complicated?

Oh tell me what to say, tell me
To make it all OK, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna see you hurting
Just hold on
Just hold on to me
I don't wanna see you crying
So hold on
So hold on to me

I'm trying to think of what to do
To really make it up to you
So many truths, too many lies
Making love can be so crazy
I find myself back here again
Asking you to let me in
You know it's time, we need to change
How can we live with all these maybes?

There are no words that say, no words
To make it go away

[Chorus]

Cause baby it's alright
I'm staying here tonight
So hold on

Just tell me what to say
To let you know
I'll always stayWhere, where are the stars?
The one that we used to call ours
Can't imagine it now
We used to laugh til we fell down

The secrets we had, now in the past
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

Now you're so far away
And I see our stars is fading
One too many times
Guess it just got tired of waiting around

The night that we thought, if these walls could talk
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you

So now does he give you love
Oh, Is it only me now that's thinking of, what we had and what we were
Oh, Did you ever care, baby was I ever there?

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
Tell me how, did we lose our way
It's hard to remember, all that we've shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone

There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

It's like I never loved you at all [Repeat: x2]You, you're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, so come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Stop (stop)
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile

Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, oh come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Hey, let me know ya (let me know ya)
You're all that matters to me (you're all that matters to me)
Hey, let me show ya (let me show ya)
You're all that matters to me (you're all that matters to me)

So come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Hey, let me know ya (let me know ya)

(Shine)
Oh come on (hey)
See the light on your face
(Oh, come on yeah)
Let it shine
Just let it shine
(Shine all your light over me)
ShineThere's a place we used to be
There's a face that I used to see
There's a picture with you by my side
There's a moment that I want to find.

I don't know where to start
Or how to begin
But I know I love you still.

If you ever turn away
If you ever change your mind
If the road ahead becomes too hard to climb
If there's something in your heart that tells you to stop
Oh to hold you close tonight
I'd wait for life.

There's a voice shouting inside my head
There's a space on your side of the bed
There's a hope every time there's a sound
There's a silence that's playing too loud

I don't know how you are
Or how you may be
But I know I love you still.

If I close my eyes
I'll dream a little deeper baby
Cause you are always on my mind
Yeah you are always on my mind
For life.I'm afraid of the morning
I'm afraid of the light
You should come with a warning
You should be wearing a sign
That says you're beautiful trouble
So you better beware
One look and I was in right over my head.

Oh this misery
There's no place on earth I'd rather be.

You're not the one I need
You're just the one that I want
Makes a perfect sense to me
You're not the one I need
But you're the one that I want
Ain't no sense of love.

I try to stop myself
So many times
But I keep falling over
I keep crossing the line
The heart of a gypsy and the soul of a stone
It's just a matter of time before you leave ma alone.

Oh sweet misery
Fill my heart up and pour it all over me.

It's not logical
That's the way I feel
It's not logical
Psychological
It's heaven underneath my skin but it's hell out here.What am I to you and what are you to me?
Are we getting better or did we used to be?
What of the song we used to sing?
Where are the souls we used to carry in?
What is a sail without hurricane?
What is a hurt without someone to blame?
Show me the sky and I'll climb the stairs
Give me something 'cause I'm losing it.

Give me what it is you believe in
Cause I give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay.

Tell me the word and I'll shout it out
For what is a voice when in doubt?
The world has changed
The world will change
Oh give me something cause I need to feel.

It's so good you know
I still love you so
And you don't have to do this on your own.
No, noWe used to walk Mancunian Way
We used to swagger we used to sway
Up until the lights took us away
Do you know what you meant to me?
We used to think we were the bomb
Then someone left a real one
We stayed indoors as the rain come
Back then it made no sense to me
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall they gave us the keys to the cit, but they don't fit anything
But I'm coming away.

I hear you calling
I came back running
Forgot that feeling
Been so log coming
They tried to stop her
She just got stronger
I'm driving home again
Back down Mancunian Way

I just forgot how it is to feel
To dance and move and keep it real
Been lying down foot ten long years
But I was there and it feels like yesterday
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall you came when I was pretty, but that don't work no more
But I'm coming anyway.

Now I stand here in front of you
I know now what I'm gonna do
My shoulders low, but my head is high
I'm gonna bring this town alive
Through this acidic rain
I'm gonna come back to life again.A little boy me went fishing in a wooden boat
Sitting there for hours in the cold
Patience is a virtue til we die
Then a ripple in the water caught my eye.

Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for
That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor
We go from green to blue to go to black
Breathe deep, who knows how long will this last.

Only was last week I learnt to drive
Stole my mother's keys and drove all night
Christine never showed it's 4 am
Started up mum's car drove home again.

One year ago I kissed my bride
Now I wait to hear my baby's cry
Woman showed me all that she knew then
To cut himself down man's born again.

Christine died and now I'm here alone
What I wouldn't give to be on that wooden boat.And the fishermen came back across the water 
And the people started running in the park 
And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms 
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us 
And the scent of burning oil was in the air 
And the music played 
And it felt so good to hear 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking 
As the tear from every cloud begin to fall 
For one moment then, we understood it all 

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming 
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women 
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter 
So come on, let me love you 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 
This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon 
A million people walking back to work 
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

You and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah, the gardenToday this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Let's make a new start
The future is ours to find
Can you see it, can you see it in my eyes
Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on (tonight)
Hold on
Hold on

Oh stay close to me (hold on)
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close me

Oh, hold your head high (hold on)
Arms open wide
Yea the world starts to come alive when you stay close it me

Today this could be the greatest day of our lives
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives

Oh and the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
Oh, oh, oh
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive) hold on
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive)
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me (hold on)
Oh (stay close to me) and the world comes alive
(Stay close to me) and the world
Watch the world come alive tonight
(Stay close to me) oh oh oh ohI'd watch the world go by in the morning
Lose myself in the the news
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I don't notice

I'd write a long love song with no meaning
And hope nobody would hear
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming

Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

I'd lock myself away in the evening
Afraid to ever come out
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings

Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh
HelloWhen the tears fall away
And there's no conversation
There's nothing left to break
That's not already broken
You're staring into space
And every inch of silence
Been standing here for days, and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

In the sudden light of day
The weight of expectation
Hurt begins to fade
As you find a new direction
Been talking here for days and days and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we said it all?Julie, what's your problem?
Won't you tell me, what's going on?
Cause there's a dark cloud, hanging over you.
You've been down, down, down too long.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside, and they're playing now, for you, for you.

Julie, come to your window.
Don't let your problems, spoil the view.
It's not a good thing, to cry today.
So come on change change change, come through the door.

There's a band outside and they're playing now for you.
You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now for you, for you.

Why why why do you cry cry cry?
You should know by now that the sun comes up for you.
Why why why do you cry cry cry?
You should know now that the sun comes up for you, that the sun comes up for you.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now, for you, for you.
You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now, for you, for you.
Sha lalalalala I want you, sha lalalalala I do.Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And I'm going round in circles every day
The more I shout the more I hesitate
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Stand up please til I'm done losing my mind
And I've thanked you all just one too many times
The more we fall the harder we must climb
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Cause everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say, to say

Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And before the music takes you all away
I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to say

I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to sayJust the other day somebody said to me
"Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But jokes aside, I can explain
It's just my way of keeping track
With living on this planet now then

Have you turned on your TV
Have you seen reality
Have you seen a program that you've spent your whole life looking for
There's a girl in Camden town
Indecision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smile at me

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

All the noises and all these lights
All these talking through the nights
All these expectation now
It's making me neurotic
Tell me, have you seen your face before
I forgot to say 'hello'
Thought I'd make it clear now
That I've always been a smiler, tell me
 
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

Sometimes it's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody said to me
"Hey maybe you are oh so slightly OCD
A little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But, jokes aside, please stay with me
It's just my way of compartmentalizing all the things I see

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to thisSometimes I see your face looking at me
All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope I've got wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

I met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"
He met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe (oh maybe) I don't need you to save me (I don't need you to save me)
I just want you to help me (I just want you to help me)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night (Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you'll stayIs it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose to for my valentine? 
What is love? 

Is it only words? 
I'm trying to find? 
Or is it the way, that we're feeling now? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

A pain or a cure? 
A science of faith? 
A reason to fall to your knees and die? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

Only you can save me now. 
Only you can heal me now. 
Only you can show me now, 
What is love. 

Or is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
What is love?Take a piece of
me and throw the rest away (throw it all away)

My lips are moving but you don't hear a word I say (nothing left
to say)

Everybody loves a mystery, everybody needs a reason to believe
Everybody has a history, everybody's hiding something up their
...(sleeve)

sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at all
Play your little game, I'll look the other way (just look the
other way)

everybody wants the sunshine, everybody is a friend of mine
sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at all
Take a closer look inside, take a closer look inside
sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at allYou can dance if you like 
You can sing every line of every song 
No, you don't have to steal the show 
It was your show all along 

As the orchestra plays 
The people take the seats 
There's no room left in this house 
Its only you and me 
And if life is your stage 
I'll be watching 

[Chorus]
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
Ill be watching 
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
And I'll be watching you. 

Everything that you do 
As we start, rehearsing every scene 
The words to everything 
We realize that the crowd is listening 
And then the tears, fall down on your face 
In exactly the right place

[Chorus]Up and down 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see me down life's highway 

Not black or white 
As crystal clear as a cloudy night 
Traveling in the name of lonely 
I was only home when you held me 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to. 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear. 

Flying home tonight 
As far away as a satellite 
Keeping your heart in my pocket 
Hope to God that I don't drop it 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come bursting through my door 

And it's here, 

where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear 
I hear 

Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time to come home 
Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time 

Up and down, 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see my down life's highway 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to 
Is here 
All the things I keep so dear I hear 

Everybody's talking now 
Everybody's walking 'round 
Everybody's dreaming 'boutI'd watch the world go by in the morning
Lose myself in the the news
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I don't notice

I'd write a long love song with no meaning
And hope nobody would hear
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming

Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

I'd lock myself away in the evening
Afraid to ever come out
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings

Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh
HelloWhen the time grew near, for me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for, hidin' from a word
I need to hear now, don't think I'll hear it again (Don't think I'll hear it again)

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (Woah)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Oh yeah)
All I do each night is think (Oh yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within (Closed the door)

If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

But the nights were always warm with you (My love)
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (All I do each night is pray)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Down on my knees)
All I do each night is think (Yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight (Woah)
Of the dream we long to live (We long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

All I do each night is pray (Come on, time is running out)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (You and me)
All I do each night is think, of all the times (On my knees, you and me)
I've closed the door to keep my love within (On my knees)
All I do each night is pray (You and me, forever more)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong (whenever I'm wrong)
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back (want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good
Oh yeah

I guess now it's time that you came back for goodWe've come so far
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young
And we hope for more

We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
We've had success
We've had good times
But remember this

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there
With danger on my mind
I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realised what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I looked so high I don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of I can't explain this feeling now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I make
And the fact of reality

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far 
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young 
And we hope for more
But remember this
We're not invincible
We're not invincible, no (we're not invincible)
We're only people (ooh)
We're only people (we're not invincible)
Hey we're not invincible (we're not invincible)
We're not invincible
So again I'll tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never (ooh, hoo, hoo) (never! Never! Never!)
Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing ooh baby
Never, no never
Never forget, oh, no
Someday
Louder, louder, louder, louder loud
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, loud now
Someday, come on, come on
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody

Never forget where you're coming from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for moreHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (come on, yeah), your love is my only desire (I need your love)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need, I need your love

Yeah, you got to be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah)
Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah
Strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side (on the other side)
And I got hope (hope) in my soul, I'll keep walkin' baby
Keep on walkin' baby

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire (only desire)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight me fire (relight my fire) relight my fire baby

Relight my fire (yeah yeah), your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your loveYou can dance if you like 
You can sing every line of every song

The people take the seats 
There's no room left in this house 
Its only you and me 
And if life is your stage

And I'll be watching you. 

Everything that you do 
As we start, rehearsing every scene 
The words to everything 
We realize that the crowd is listening 
And then the tears, fall down on your face 
In exactly the right place

[Chorus]Today this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Let's make a new start
The future is ours to find
Can you see it, can you see it in my eyes
Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on (tonight)

Oh stay close to me (hold on)

Oh (stay close to me) and the world comes alive
(Stay close to me) and the world
Watch the world come alive tonight
(Stay close to me) oh oh oh ohAnd the fishermen came back across the water 
And the people started running in the park 
And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms 
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us 
And the scent of burning oil was in the air 
And the music played 
And it felt so good to hear 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking 
As the tear from every cloud begin to fall 
For one moment then, we understood it all 

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming 
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women 
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter 
So come on, let me love you 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 
This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon 
A million people walking back to work 
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

You and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah, the gardenYou, you're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, so come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Stop (stop)
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile

Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, oh come on, get it on

All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope I've got wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

I met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"
He met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

'Cause you're keeping me up all night (Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you'll stayJust the other day somebody said to me
"Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But jokes aside, I can explain
It's just my way of keeping track
With living on this planet now then

Have you turned on your TV
Have you seen reality
Have you seen a program that you've spent your whole life looking for
There's a girl in Camden town
Indecision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smile at me

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

All the noises and all these lights
All these talking through the nights
All these expectation now
It's making me neurotic
Tell me, have you seen your face before
I forgot to say 'hello'
Thought I'd make it clear now
That I've always been a smiler, tell me
 
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

Sometimes it's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody said to me
"Hey maybe you are oh so slightly OCD
A little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But, jokes aside, please stay with me
It's just my way of compartmentalizing all the things I see

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to thisSilence please 'cause I've got something to say
And I'm going round in circles every day
The more I shout the more I hesitate
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Stand up please til I'm done losing my mind
And I've thanked you all just one too many times
The more we fall the harder we must climb
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Cause everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say, to say

Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And before the music takes you all away
I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to say

I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to sayIs it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose to for my valentine? 
What is love? 

Is it only words? 
I'm trying to find? 
Or is it the way, that we're feeling now? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

A pain or a cure? 
A science of faith? 
A reason to fall to your knees and die? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

Only you can save me now. 
Only you can heal me now. 
Only you can show me now, 
What is love. 

Or is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
What is love?When the tears fall away
And there's no conversation
There's nothing left to break
That's not already broken
You're staring into space
And every inch of silence
Been standing here for days, and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

In the sudden light of day
The weight of expectation
Hurt begins to fade
As you find a new direction
Been talking here for days and days and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

At the start of whatever,
Shouting love at the world.
Back then, we were like cavemen,
But we map the moon and the stars,
Then we forgave them.

We will meet you where the lights are,
The defenders, of the faith we are.
Where the thunder turns around
They'll run so hard we'll tear the ground away.

You know no one dies,
In these love drowned eyes,
Through our love drowned eyes,
We'll watch you sleep tonight.

Although no one understood
We were holding back the flood,
Learning how to dance the rain.
We were holding back the flood
They said we'd never dance again.

Bleeding, but none of us leaving,
Watch your mouth son or you'll find yourself floating home.
Here we come now on a dark star,
Seeing demons, not what we are.

Tiny minds and eager hands
Will try to strike but now will end today.

There's progress now where there once was none,
Where there once was none, then everything came along.

Although no one understood,
We were holding back the flood learning how to dance the rain.
There was more of them than us now they'll never dance again.

Although no one understood

Go tell Eve and go tell Adam
Liberate your sons and daughters
Some are gods and some are monsters
We'll get a five minute warning for divine intervention
With the satellites falling prepare for ascension

Under mind control
We'll be practicing our politics
Defending all our policies
Preparing for apocalypse
Don't let the hungry serpent see you no
No, no, no, no, no

She'll let you fall asleep then eat you whole
It's like a bullet to the head
It's an SOS, it's an S.O.S.,
Oh yes, oh yes, it's an S.O.S.
It's an SOS, it's an S.O.S.,
Like a bullet in the head, it's an S.O.S.

When the levee breaks
And Manhattan sinks
There won't be water fit to drink
When the winter's warm
And the summer's cold
The poison stops you looking old

You'll get a five second warning for divine and intervention
And the satellites are falling prepare for ascension
As the earth looks on
The odds or probability
Of losing all capacity
To function it's hereditary
No antibiotic can save us now
No, no, no, no, no
We are the virus that we talk about

It's like a bullet to the head

Like a bullet in the head, it's an S.O.S.You're no angel, I'm no saint, if we were
We wouldn't be in this place tonight

Lost and lonely, scared and confused
We both have a past, nothing to lose, tonight
Well it cuts like a knife these bad luck blues
We both got scars from the hell we been through
Somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide

Reconnected, feelin' no pain
Seeking shelter like a spark in the rain, tonight (ooh yeah)
Worn and weathered, scared to go home
We're here together, but still all alone, tonight (uh uh yeah)
And there's no need to lie, we've both been abused
The love and the pain, the cocaine and booze, now
Most people don't, but some people do

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collideKings and Queens and Presidents
Ministers of Governments
Welcome to the future of your world

Through talking heads that took liberties
The monkeys learnt to build machines
They think they'll get to heaven through the universe

They say nothing
Deny everything
And make counter accusations

Youth don't leave me, hair stay on me
God I love those hips
Oh memory don't forsake me
Not like this

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectible, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things

They're still out there somewhere
Making men feel this way
At fallen Broadway station
I see them every day, all day

Download a little meditation
It might pull you through
She blinded me with silence
Anchored here with you

There's a surge in my psychosis every turn of the screw
And I'm half awake in paisley print.
I can see the world clearly but I have to squint.
I am a supersonic specimen.
A minor miracle of medicine
I'm at the mercy of unwanted emotions.
Where nothing matters, beneath my thoughts
Beneath my thoughts is where it happens.
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements, replace me
Was it a positive experiment?
To be indefinitely decadent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I'm at the back of the club and so afraid to speak
Cos I'm not like these people
And these people are not like me
Super heavy elements, upgrade me
Supersonic elements amaze me
Your opinion is irrelevant
I was built to be magnificent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I haven't scratched the surface of my desire
In the world of dreams, I'm a frequent flier
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements,

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I'm feeling immortal
We'll live forever now
We'll live forever nowI, I'm just a piece of your pie chart 
You're in a room with a rock star 
Only I play the good parts of a kind heart 
The sky's too low and the room's too dark 
But she just carries on 
And I get her in but her friend gets turned away 
But what can I say? 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
You might be good looking, 
But you can't sleep with yourself tonight 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 

Oh I, I wish that beggars were choosers 
Unload my love like a looter 
I need some gas and a kick start, for a good heart 
The lighting's cheap, and the room is cold 
But she just carries on 
And you'll get no sleep 
But you might be turned away 
So what will you say? 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
You might be good looking, 
But you can't sleep with yourself tonight 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
If you're so good looking 
Why don't you sleep with yourself tonight? 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
You've gotta get it while you can 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a manMy greatest fear is we're just wasting tears
Wasting several years, still being round here
My greatest fear is maybe you will notice
I'm not what you wanted after all these years

But I, I've got a very big hope for us
I'm gonna keep looking up for us
It's been a difficult year
And I, I still wanna make love with you
So where do we go from here?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I still think I belong with you,
I still wanna belong to you
So what do you want from me
What do you want from me now?

Your greatest fear is we're not getting wiser,
We're not wise at all
It's getting harder, harder to recover
From the night before, when you turn me on
But I, I like to think of us moving on
I like to think of us getting on
So answer me where do we go from here,
Where do we go?

Because I, I still wanna get old with you
I still want us to grow
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I still think I'm in love with you
I still feel you're the one
So what do you want from me,

Has it crossed your mind we might already know?
If we only let it go?

Yeah I, I still wanna have sex with you
I still wanna go out with you
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I think some days we're beautiful
I think some days we're not
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?

Let's make it positive
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?
We're making progress here, so where shall we go?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?My greatest fear is we're just wasting tears
Wasting several years, still being round here
My greatest fear is maybe you will notice
I'm not what you wanted after all these years

But I, I've got a very big hope for us
I'm gonna keep looking up for us
It's been a difficult year

Your greatest fear is we're not getting wiser,
We're not wise at all
It's getting harder, harder to recover
From the night before, when you turn me on
But I, I like to think of us moving on
I like to think of us getting on
So answer me where do we go from here,
Where do we go?

Because I, I still wanna get old with you
I still want us to grow
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I still think I'm in love with you
I still feel you're the one
So what do you want from me,
What do you want from me now?

Has it crossed your mind we might already know?
If we only let it go?

Yeah I, I still wanna have sex with you
I still wanna go out with you
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I think some days we're beautiful
I think some days we're not
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?

Let's make it positive
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?
We're making progress here, so where shall we go?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?It's just a fraction of time,
Until we move into reverse,
Can feel the pressure and all the minds,
And the whole Universe.
Is it a question of force,
And a physical law,
We've had this battle a thousand times,
Never been here before,
Never been here before.

Haven't got the strength to fight anymore,
Got no desire to die anymore,

I want to see you again, again, again,
Haven't got the strength to fight anymore,
Don't even know what I'm fighting forWe became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned
Expendable soldiers smiling at anything
Raised on a feeling our lives would have meaning eventually

We were once the answer and then you discover
You're actually just one thing after another
And what was the question and why was the lesson so deafening?

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And outside forces didn't make it easy
So I thought I'd go before you leave me
Self-preservation was no explanation for anything

But the truth is more than we'll ever comprehend
I'm just starting to understand, my friend
All of that distance, 'cause I fell in love with the enemy

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

At last, we meet on no man's land
Just footprints in the sand
We meet on no man's land, at last

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

One meaning
Just one meaningDarling please forgive me
I was sitting on the fence
I was slowly going out of head
I did not hear a word that you said
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbed

If I could take your blows, If I could get pass go,
If I could find a way of fixing the things that I broke
Then I would, if I could
And I might understand now I ended outta mind
And I might understand now I ended outta mind

But the truth is hard to find
When it's playing tricks with your mind
Darling please forgive me
I was hanging with my friends
I was slowly getting outta my head
I did not hear a word that you said
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbed
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbedStanding, on the edge of forever,
At the start of whatever,
Shouting love at the world.
Back then, we were like cavemen,
But we map the moon and the stars,
Then we forgave them.

We will meet you where the lights are,
The defenders, of the faith we are.
Where the thunder turns around 
They'll run so hard we'll tear the ground away.

You know no one dies, 
In these love drowned eyes,
Through our love drowned eyes, 
We'll watch you sleep tonight.

Although no one understood 
We were holding back the flood,
Learning how to dance the rain.
We were holding back the flood 
They said we'd never dance again.

Bleeding, but none of us leaving,
Watch your mouth son or you'll find yourself floating home.
Here we come now on a dark star, 
Seeing demons, not what we are.

Tiny minds and eager hands 
Will try to strike but now will end today.

There's progress now where there once was none, 
Where there once was none, then everything came along.

Although no one understood, 
We were holding back the flood learning how to dance the rain.
There was more of them than us now they'll never dance again.

Although no one understood

There was more of them than us now they'll never dance again.

Now we'll never dance again.

Oh ah, 
Oh ah, 
Oh ah, 
Oh ah,
Oh ah, 
Oh ah, 
Oh ahSave our souls we're splitting atoms
Go tell Eve and go tell Adam
Liberate your sons and daughters
Some are gods and some are monsters
We'll get a five minute warning for divine intervention
With the satellites falling prepare for ascension

Under mind control
We'll be practicing our politics
Defending all our policies
Preparing for apocalypse
Don't let the hungry serpent see you no
No, no, no, no, no

She'll let you fall asleep then eat you whole
It's like a bullet to the head
It's an SOS, it's an S.O.S.,
Oh yes, oh yes, it's an S.O.S.
It's an SOS, it's an S.O.S.,
Like a bullet in the head, it's an S.O.S.

When the levee breaks
And Manhattan sinks
There won't be water fit to drink
When the winter's warm
And the summer's cold
The poison stops you looking old

You'll get a five second warning for divine and intervention
And the satellites are falling prepare for ascension
As the earth looks on
The odds or probability
Of losing all capacity
To function it's hereditary
No antibiotic can save us now
No, no, no, no, no
We are the virus that we talk about

It's like a bullet to the head
It's an S.O.S., it's an S.O.S.,
Oh yes, oh yes, it's an S.O.S.
It's an S.O.S., it's an S.O.S.,

Like a bullet in the head, it's an S.O.S.You're no angel, I'm no saint, if we were
We wouldn't be in this place tonight

Lost and lonely, scared and confused
We both have a past, nothing to lose, tonight
Well it cuts like a knife these bad luck blues
We both got scars from the hell we been through
Somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide

Reconnected, feelin' no pain
Seeking shelter like a spark in the rain, tonight (ooh yeah)
Worn and weathered, scared to go home
We're here together, but still all alone, tonight (uh uh yeah)
And there's no need to lie, we've both been abused
The love and the pain, the cocaine and booze, now
Most people don't, but some people do

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collideKings and Queens and Presidents
Ministers of Governments
Welcome to the future of your world

Through talking heads that took liberties
The monkeys learnt to build machines
They think they'll get to heaven through the universe

They say nothing
Deny everything
And make counter accusations
My friends, my dear, my love, my God

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all?
The Good, the Bad, the Ugly or the Beautiful

Because it's up hill and against the wind
With no-one there to let us in
Leave your thoughts and save yourself you fool

The daggers of science
Evolving into violence
We're not sure where the fallout blows
But we all know ·

Youth don't leave me, hair stay on me
God I love those hips
Oh memory don't forsake me
Not like this

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectible, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things

They're still out there somewhere
Making men feel this way
At fallen Broadway station
I see them every day, all day

Download a little meditation
It might pull you through
She blinded me with silence
Anchored here with you

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectible, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectible, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things

Does she talk like ooh ooh ooh
Will it feel like ah ah ah
Does she tell you what she wants
Can you give her what she needs

There's a surge in my psychosis every turn of the screw
And I'm half awake in paisley print.
I can see the world clearly but I have to squint.
I am a supersonic specimen.
A minor miracle of medicine
I'm at the mercy of unwanted emotions.
Where nothing matters, beneath my thoughts
Beneath my thoughts is where it happens.
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements, replace me
Was it a positive experiment?
To be indefinitely decadent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I'm at the back of the club and so afraid to speak
Cos I'm not like these people
And these people are not like me
Super heavy elements, upgrade me
Supersonic elements amaze me
Your opinion is irrelevant
I was built to be magnificent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I haven't scratched the surface of my desire
In the world of dreams, I'm a frequent flier
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements,

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I'm feeling immortal
We'll live forever now
We'll live forever nowI, I'm just a piece of your pie chart 
You're in a room with a rock star 
Only I play the good parts of a kind heart 
The sky's too low and the room's too dark 
But she just carries on 
And I get her in but her friend gets turned away 
But what can I say? 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
You might be good looking, 
But you can't sleep with yourself tonight 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 

Oh I, I wish that beggars were choosers 
Unload my love like a looter 
I need some gas and a kick start, for a good heart 
The lighting's cheap, and the room is cold 
But she just carries on 
And you'll get no sleep 
But you might be turned away 
So what will you say? 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
You might be good looking, 
But you can't sleep with yourself tonight 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
If you're so good looking 
Why don't you sleep with yourself tonight? 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
You've gotta get it while you can 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a manMy greatest fear is we're just wasting tears
Wasting several years, still being round here
My greatest fear is maybe you will notice
I'm not what you wanted after all these years

But I, I've got a very big hope for us
I'm gonna keep looking up for us
It's been a difficult year
And I, I still wanna make love with you
So where do we go from here?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I still think I belong with you,
I still wanna belong to you
So what do you want from me
What do you want from me now?

Your greatest fear is we're not getting wiser,
We're not wise at all
It's getting harder, harder to recover
From the night before, when you turn me on
But I, I like to think of us moving on
I like to think of us getting on
So answer me where do we go from here,
Where do we go?

Because I, I still wanna get old with you
I still want us to grow
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I still think I'm in love with you
I still feel you're the one

Careless and cold
We did what we were told in our lives
When we were young
Had the world by the tail
Good would prevail
Starships at sail
And none of us would fail in this life
Not when you're young

We were drawn to whoever could keep us together
And bound by the heavens above
And we tried to survive traveling at the speed of love

Woah when we were young
When we adored the fabulous
Woah when we were young
We were the foolish fearless
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
Woah when we were young

In a moment of grace
A long leap of faith
The still more glorious dawn awaits
It's my life
I'm here with the lovers

And we burned the bridges
We're crossing over
Just to see the firelight
And the innocent are getting over
Being old tonight

Woah when we were young
When everything was what it seemed
Woah when we were young
And everyday was how we dreamed
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
Woah when we were young

And when you look at yourself tonight
Are you someone you recognize?
You can take back what you've given away
But it must be the last time

Woah when we were young
Woah when we were young
When we were young

Woah when we were young
When we adored the fabulous
Woah when we were young

The work is done
A place for everything til everything is in its place
And every setting sun
When the work was done
Was a day that didn't go to waste
When all the work is done
It will be done
Producing everything for everything to be replaced
And in dirty towns we will settle down
Manufacture for the human race

The greatest story that was ever told in the lights of history
Was the grand designs of other men
And they built those walls for you and me

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men
Don't start thinking with your heart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men

When the work is done, the work is done
We'll bebionic and beyond the circuits of our minds
We'll get nothing done under electric sun
Leave the weight of labor far behind

We're the greatest story that was ever told
But we don't know where we're from
And the walls became but a memory
Of the days when all the work begun

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men

Rejoice the day, the day the work is done
Rejoice the day, the day the work is done

Let all that lives be free to die
We're all, we're all key to life
Face all that rage and history
It makes no sense to you and me
We're all, we're all free to fight
I broke all my vows, my common sense
Says find vocation somewhere else

This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
Tonight

Lay all that's sinful down to rest
May all our judgments be confessed
We're all, we're all guilty now
Drink for the crowd not for yourself
Til someone hears your cry for help
Let's all, let's all take a bow
I spent all my mind on making sense
It made no difference in the end
This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
Tonight

I close my eyes and I am somebody else
Tonight I close my eyes and I don't need any help
Every moment of laughter
Every moment I fear
Every moment that you're not here

This should've been so beautiful, so beautiful, be so beautiful
This should have been so beautiful, been so beautiful

This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
TonightDon't stay where you are not loved
Those people obscure the view
But if I've done my job
They won't wanna mess with you

Finding some romances
A place where you exist
Live with your mother' smile
But see you through daddy's eyes

You might lose your dignity
But it's not what it used to be

And don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like kings and queens
I'll be the first, the last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to me

Just listen to your heart
Not the voices in your head
Forget how it'd made you feel
But don't forget what was said

Tears are words than we can touch
When words only say so much
Look out? what you've got
Then you'll always have enough

You might lose your dignity
But look what its done for me

And don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like kings and queens
I'll be the first, the last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to me

And don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like kings and queens
I'll be the first, the last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to meAlien Alien Alien Alien Alien Alien Alien Alien

Through the carnage of the crash
Baby I'm with you
And the photos in a flash
Baby I'm with you
Through violent seas
Baby I'm with you
Until release
Baby I'm with you
And all the animals in the park
Are waiting for their dinner to come
And all the creatures in the dark
Are waiting for the light to come on

We are the aliens,we are, we are, we are alien
God loves the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
All the animals in the park, alien
And all the strangers that wake up in the dark
Are waiting for the light to come on

Alien Alien

Through electronic desire
Baby I'm with you
And the elements of fire
Baby I'm with you
Through everything
Baby I'm with you
All the counterfeited scream tonight
When all the elevated
Become illuminated

We are the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
God loves the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
All the animals in the park, alien
And all the strangers that wake up in the dark
Are waiting for the light to come on

AlienWhat a wonderful world this is
What a wonderful world this is
It makes me want to kiss
What a beautiful kiss this is
What a beautiful kiss of life
Just before I die
I've been spending time
I've been losing time

Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet
All those minutes get lost in time
One step forward two steps behind
So before I think myself too deep
What a wonderful world this is
What a wonderful world this is
What a delicate tale of bliss
That I don't want to miss
In this moment where we all exist
On the precipice of the abyss
It always was, how it is
Spending time, wasting time
I've been spending time, I've been wasting time

Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet
All those minutes get lost in time
One step forward two steps behind
So before I think myself too deep
What a wonderful world this is

No time
Am I losing my mind
No time
Am I losing my mind
There's no time for us, no time for us until we're out of time (we're
Running out of time)
There's no time for us, no time
What a wonderful world this is
There's no time for us, no time (we're running out of time)
(Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keepOh I can see the future
Coming to you
Crying with the sadness in your eyes
And I can find a faith in years I've wasted
Being around enough to feel alive
And when the world is broken, hurt and colder
No one ever knows the reason why
For the ones we may become
For the balance we have won
For the day we wish the sun
Gonna play it loud tonight

When you dream of a dream
And you live in the world
Every hope is a hope
For the best don't want you resting my bones
And you're calling me now
I will see you all the time
Should be out there living the life
And not just watching you

Take me back
Before we all explode
Before we turn to stone
Before the light is gone
Take me back
To where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before the day goes off

Tonight we gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight, we'll remember
We'll remember these days

What a day to believe
To believe in the night
Want a date to belong, to a face in the crowd to the beat of your heart
And the moment begin
And you're working it out
And you're holding us all
In your hands, don't want you waiting for

Take me back
Before we lose control
Before the tables turn
Before we break it off
Take me back
To where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before they take us off

Tonight we gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight, we'll remember
We'll remember these days

Oh I can see the future
Coming to you
Crying with the sadness in your eyes
And I can find a faith in years I've wasted
Being around enough to feel alive
And when the world is broken, hurt and colder
No one ever knows the reason why
For the ones we may become
For the balance we have won
For the day we wish the sun
Gonna play it loud tonight

In the darkness you must enter the code
And crack the combination all on your own

Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life?
Do you really love life?
Do you really love life? 
Do you really love life?

Hard up, cut me up
Good day, out of luck
My bones set in stone
Dear Lord, take me home
Crowd surf, out of bounds
Drink till we're falling down
Made up that you came
Big dreams till the end
Some say we came out of the sea 
Long time ago it's true
I come out of the ocean
To make my peace with you
I'm only fighting for you girl
I'm only fighting for the world
Before they bring me down
Out of Heaven to the ground 

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life?
Do you really love life?

Forward, sweep me up
High tide, good enough
Sad face, when we're low
Always, step to the right
Amen, ready made
Bad dreams, out again
Fireworks, good to know
Today's the start of the weekend

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life? 

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life?

What a way, what a way
What a way to go
Maybe something
Maybe nothing
But it's all I know
What a way, what a way
What a way to go 
Giving all my love 

What a way, what a way
What a way to go
Maybe something
Maybe nothing
But it's all I know
What a way, what a way
What a way to go 
Giving all my love

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life?

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life?Life slow down
You've gone too fast
And words begin to mean a little less

Bones stay strong
Cause the road ahead is long
And every voice will miss us when we're gone

Take a portrait, 25 let me hear you singing it out

You're free to come alive
You're free to come tonightI used to be broken
Stuck in a cage
I used to be low down
I couldn't be saved
Now I feel like a lion
That cannot be tamed
'Cause you brought me back to life, to life again

I was fearless but so easily
I let life fade away the colour of my dreams
Now you're with me, I know I can be
Higher, higher than higher

(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be on the ground
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be out of my mind
Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be lost in the fire
If you weren't, you weren't here
Couldn't open up my eyes
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)

The sky is a long way
When covered in rain
You gave me my vision
You gave me my faith
And now I'm a fighter
I found the flame
You set me alight, alight again

I was fearless but so easily
I let life fade away the colour of my dreams
Now you're with me, I know I can be
Higher, higher than higher

(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be on the ground
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be out of my mind
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be lost in the fire
If you weren't, you weren't here
Couldn't open up my eyes
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)

And it's all for me

Yeah when it's all for me
I can get away to a better place
Hey I'm looking down
Yeah I'm looking down
I can see you now
Are you coming out

There's a voice in my head
And it's talking again
Out of time, out of space
It's a feeling a meaning that I can taste

I don't know what people see but I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
I don't know why people give but I'll take it (I'll take it), I'll take it (I'll take it)

Out of time, out of space
It's a feeling a meaning that I can taste

I don't know what people see but I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
I don't know why people give but I'll take it (I'll take it), I'll take it (I'll take it)

Always leave them wanting more

And a little bit of conversation
With a head full of hope
And a bit of your self belief
Is it asking too much to
Rely on your imagination
Am I asking too much
To remain in your company
Stop everything

We can stay here if you hold still
We can stay here for life if you say you will
We'll be caught in a moment of time
If we all freeze...
Don't even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won't leave
Freeze

With the flicker of a promise
And in view of our situation
I think you should know
That I never wanted this to change
And you're free to say whatever you want to
But whatever you want, whatever you want
Don't change
Please don't change

We can stay here if you hold still
We can stay here for life if you say you will
We'll be caught in a moment of time
If we all freeze...
Don't even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won't leave

The words, the words we never say
Don't make a sound till it's too late
Just freeze so we don't have to start again
Before we make the same mistakes
Before we throw it all away
The words, the words we never say
Don't make a sound till it's too late
Just freeze so we don't have to start again
Before we make the same mistakes

Don't even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won't leave

Tied up again with my one and only friend

Staying out of trouble staying in and out of touch
In and out of touch I can never get enough
Up tight, tied up again 
Some things will never change

It's almost like we go
Dance with desire then we go playing with fire
Then we go into the wild again

Dance with desire then we go playing with fire
Then we go into the wild again

Get back, get back to town
These city lights gonna bring us home tonight

So long ago it's a story to be told

Staying out of trouble staying in and out of touch
In and out of touch I can never get enough
Get back, get back to town
Please come around tonight

And if you see tomorrow I'll give you it all

But we know there's something in the silence
There's something in the silence

Didn't stop, all this space
It makes me want to see your face
Such a beautiful place
When I met you last I was at a loss
Life goes on
Breakin' hard into the ground
It was you that I found

I can run if you are callin'
I can fly if you are fallin'
I can break through every wall they build for me
I can see the sun is risin'
I can see your eyes are smilin'
I will hold onto the things that I believe
Believe

Shut my eyes I feel alive
Hold me back
In our hearts, we'll wear the scars
Of the wilderness years
Give me one more night at last
Filled with joy
When your guard is down
And you're hand in hand
Will you understand how lucky we are
It's been a very long day

I can run if you are callin'
I can fly if you are fallin'
I can break through every wall they build for me
I can see the sun is risin'
I can see your eyes are smilin'
I will hold onto the things that I believe
Believe

When your guard is down
And you're hand in hand
Will you understand how lucky we are
It's been a very long day

Close your eyes and you will see
Tell me now won't let me go
Let me know if you believeNobody knows if I told you you'd laugh out loud
If you heard her voice calling your name you'd never be the same
Nothing was new and nowhere was safe and sound
And then she arrived, oh just in time to save this heart of mine
Oh, I'd waited all my life

All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My head's in the clouds I'm no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing

Maybe she knows, and maybe she'll soon be mine
In a perfect world, you know that this girl would be right here tonight
Weighing heavy on my mind

All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My head's in the clouds I'm no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing

Maybe my heart and my head are colliding
Or maybe it's more than I dare to believe
Don't ever let me forget what I'm feeling
Or wake up to find that it's all just a dream

All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My head's in the clouds that I'm no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazingGive me your hurt if you need someone to blame
Give me your call if you need someone to save
I'll take the salt and all the weight of your tears
All of your fears I'm gonna take them away
Take them away

For all your days inspired
By the beauty of your timing
And those endless acts of kindness

I want to give you more, give you more
I only want to let you know
I will be here for you, here for you
How far can we go

Till the last of the daylight survives

And return to be discovered

Everybody's feeling wonderlandWe're all giants, I can't believe it
We were giants all along
On the surface and all around us
We are giants, we are strong

I see you standing, see you dancing
On the pavement, in the park
We are giants, can you feel it
So much bigger than we thought

I think I might be heading out of body
I've gotta love, you've gotta love somebody

When I look in your eyes
I'm bigger than the night sky
As high as the sun, high as a storm
We are giants, we are giants
We are giants

There are giants across the water
There are giants heading home
In the middle of the madness
There are giants being born

I feel us breaking out of empty glory
I've gotta love, you've gotta love somebody like you

When I look in your eyes
I'm bigger than the night sky
As high as the sun, high as a storm
We are giants, we are giants
When I look in your eyes

As high as the sun, high as a storm
We are giants, we are giants
We are giantsFall, fall, fall
Oh oh oh 
Woke up from a bad dream
I was feeling half-naked, running down the high street
Shouting your name, I was begging you not to go
Yesterday's news is yesterday's news
Yesterday's blues is just a shade of colour
Call me naive but we're building for tomorrow
So we can
So we can finish off what we started
 
Wake up, it's a brand new day
Everybody's gotta sing this storm away
So come along now and lead the way
Oh make way through the waterfalls
'Cause together we will soon get it past it all
No one ever needs to fall
No one ever needs to fall
Fall, fall, fall
No one ever needs to fall

All into position
One final frontier 'til we make it to the station
Heading up to Zion, listening to the radio
Too much to regret, yeah
Still, I'm a monome yeah, not a multi-tasker
Talking revolution, talking revolution
I talk about you all the time

Wake up, it's a brand new day
Everybody's gotta sing this storm away
So come along now, lead the way
(So come along now, lead the way)
Make way through the waterfalls
'Cause together we will soon get it past it all
No one ever needs to fall
No one ever needs to fall, fall

We can lose it all, can lose it all tonight (fall)
We can make it out, can make it out alive (fall)
If we can give it all, can give it all the time (fall)
We can finish off what we started

Wake up, it's a brand new day
Everybody's gotta sing this storm away
So come along now, lead the way

Every morning it is a brand new day
Every morning it is a brand new day
Every morning it is a brand new dayI left my shadow in the bedroom
I need to shake away the fuzz
Too much attention can destroy you
Too much affection not enough
You got me hooked, I'm fascinated
My body's crawling on all fours
Before I lose myself to Mother Nature
Before I get myself some more

Because the world is changing (our world is changing)
Because you turn me on

I'm gonna count my lucky stars
I love you just the way you are
I'm gonna count my lucky stars
I love you just the way you are

No need to ask me for direction
Hold back the side of our control
I'll take your word as confirmation
All of the sky into my soul
While they are searching for perfection
I'm trying not to understand
You may have lost me in your conversation
You may have found me in the end

Because the world is changing (our world is changing)
Because you turn me on

I'm gonna count my lucky stars
I love you just the way you are
I'm gonna count my lucky stars
I love you just the way you are

Yeah, our thoughts divided
Before the night has faded
Stay with me 'til Sunday morning
Won't you stay 'til Sunday morning?

I'm gonna count my lucky stars
I love you just the way you are

I love you just the way you areIf life was simple
Every day like Sunday afternoon
There'd be no reason
To wake up, fight back, be a better you

Come dance by the fire
'Til you're feeling higher than the State of Empire
Let that New York feeling kill your pain into your ears
Let the rhythm dry your tears
As the world stops

And the band plays
Walking to the light all of a sudden
And the band plays
Always making something out of nothing
Turn your heartache into loving
And the band plays

Beware the straight roads
Or they'll catch you sleeping at the wheel, yeah yeah yeah
The warning sirens are more than sounds
There's something you can feel

Come let down your hair Let your despair be shared
You can dance in your bed let that downtown feeling
Kill your pain and all your fears Let the rhythm dry your tears
As the work stops

And the band plays
Walking to the light all of a sudden And the band plays
We're always making something out of nothing
Turn your heartache into loving
And the band plays

And the band plays
Boom boom boom
Pow wow wow
Crashing on the symbals
And the band plays
Boom boom boom
Pow wow wow
Can you hear the trumpets
Screaming at the trombones oh 
Walking to the light all of a sudden
And the band plays
You know we're always making something out of nothing
Turn your heartache into loving
And the band playsStanding on a ledge, looking down
Somebody shouting 'don't jump, don't hit the ground'
Standing here closer to the moon, get my halo ready
Don't worry, I'll be there soon

Somewhere up ahead I hear it coming
Like a bullet to the brain
Somewhere in the crowd I feel the loving
Will we ever be the same?

I'm a superstar
I'm a superstar
I'm a superstar
It's gonna be a long way down

Lying on train track, ooh, there's a train coming
Faster than a hurricane
Don't mind me, look away, I'm the stranger
No one knew that I could save the day

Put me on a list, my name and number
Tell them that I've come so far
Gonna be as loud as rain and thunder
And now I'm ready for the stars

I'm a superstar
I'm a superstar

It's gonna be a long way down

Can you see me right now?
Can you hear me right now?

Face the lonely fear
Imagine that the tightrope was here
There's angels in the silence
The taste of your own tears
Is cold

Everybody needs a little hope, hope, hope
(Hope, hope, hope)

Bathe in every blessing
Burn your brightest flame
Love's the only bible we claim
Hide from every judgement
Trust what can can't be seen
And dream

Everybody needs a little hope, hope, hope

Everybody needs a little hopeOh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I spent my time here just holding on
Afraid to let go, the weight's swinging in my soul
No time for shaking this heavy load
Before I take myself down, sinking like a stone

Gotta get myself together
Gotta wash my body clean
If I try to live forever
Gonna be the death of me
'Cause a ghost is in the water
And it's haunted by the future
Gotta leave himself to nature
Gotta take me to the sea

Let me be a river, won't you carry me?
I can hear you calling me (you calling me)
Gotta trust that river gonna lead me somewhere
Be a river, won't you carry me?
I can hear you calling me (you calling me)
Gotta trust that river gonna lead me somewhere

Be a river, won't you carry me?
I can hear you calling me

I'm going down with the waterfall
Heading to places they haven't made a record for
Keep on the good side of every low
Nowhere to hide, no horizon, nowhere to go

Sometimes I feel you with me
Sometimes I go alone
Sometimes you give your blessing
Sometimes I feel the love
That river gonna take me there, that river gonna take me there
That river gonna take me there, yeah, I know that river gonna take me there

That river gonna take me there, that river gonna take me there
That river gonna take me there, yeah, I know that river gonna take me there

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Left on Earth
Known by all as man of words
If was the last poet heard by all
They would watch as the silence roars

Got my hands up, oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta stand up, oh, oh, oh, oh

But for you I can't find words
But for you I can't find words

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

With a broken feather
And unused ink
Going crazy trying to translate what I think
When we see something so beautiful
A monastery of light and soul
Stand taller than the high cathedral walls

Got my hands up, oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta stand up, oh, oh, oh, oh

But for you I can't find words
But for you I can't find words
But for you I can't find words
But for you there are no words

Last poet, last man in this century
To lay down with no sympathy
To put words where they shouldn't be
The last poet, last man in this century
To lay down with no sympathy
To put words where they shouldn't be
Oh, they shouldn't be
They shouldn't be there
They shouldn't be thereI can still believe the sky
Isn't rolling through the night
While I sleep fast like a stone
And the ground we're standing on
Is what we fixed ourselves upon
Go on, you can't change what you know

There were chances left untaken
Lost diversions in the road
And far-off islands in the sea
A house of flowers
A chapter and a verse
A sheet of white where we all shared our dreams

And we turn every revolution
Every revolution, bringing us symphonies
Take a breath and count our lucky days
Hold me here with every revolution
Pulling together now
There's a brand new life in my soul, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Now there's water in the well
And the ring has found a bell
To tell the world we're not alone
From the silent sky a plane arrives
I feel like I've been waiting all my life
To welcome you back home

There's a wave coming in to break
The tension as we crash upon the beach
Up ahead the blanket full of stars
A pencil sketch to lie down underneath

And we turn every revolution
Every revolution bringing us symphonies
Take a breath and count our lucky days
Hold me here with every revolution
Pulling together now
There's a brand new life in my soul, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

And we turn every revolution
Every revolution bringing us symphonies
Take a breath and count our lucky days
Hold me here with every revolution
Pulling together now
There's a brand new life in my soul, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-ohThe world is smiling
It's a little brighter
There's less politics
A little more laughter
Wars become silent
Everything's different
Nothing is hurting
And it's all working
Look at the courage
That's emanating
Saving the hearts
That were breaking
Oh yeah, it's coming
To those who are waiting
You know that it's true

It's all for you
The sun and the clouds and the blue
It's all for you
It's coming in bloom for you (for you)

Birds are singing
Quiet celebration
Right through the universe
And all across the nation
Tired hearts hoping
Building what was broken
A strength in the community
A reason to believe
Look at the message
It's high and low
If you don't listen, you'll never know
Let go of your chains
Oh, come out of your cage
The road it's all leading to

It's all for you
The sun and the clouds and the blue
It's all for you
It's coming in bloom for you

Everyone around you, everyone that's missing
'Til the light can find you
No one's gonna know
Everyone around you, everyone that needs you
No, don't leave us waiting
Everyone should know

Everyone around you, everyone that's missing
'Til the light can find you
No one's gonna know

No, don't leave us waiting
Everyone should know

It's all for you (all for you)
It's all for you (all for you)
It's all for you
It's waiting here for you
It's all for you (all for you)
It's all for you (all for you)
It's all for you
It's waiting here for you
High in the clouds above, you know, you know, you know
It's here for you
Waiting here for youI've disappointed you, I know
But I've learned that wholeheartedly
I want you back
And I'm sad, sad that I hurt you so wrong
Now I'm here taking so seriously my monogamy

Oh, so don't, don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't, don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me

If I could turn back time, I would
Every word say it so differently if I could
But here in the present tense for us
Let me show you what I would do for your love
I'll be a priest or a saint
Be a lion you can tame
Give you wings to be free
Be the balance you need
I'll be a martyr or a hero
Be the answer when you don't know
I can change what you see
Can be better so please, please, please

Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't, don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me

Hope you can hear my voice right here
Why does it feel that you're so far away but so near
We've escaped from the loudest voice so now
We can conquer any mountain without falling down
I'll be a priest (priest) or a saint (or a saint)
Be the lion you can tame
Give you wings to be free

Taking all day long to read it all
Staring in the face of what's to come
Coming down I've saved a space for you

Up, up
Thought you wanted to be up
Thought you wanted to be loved
Don't you want to be loved?

Who could live without the harmony
The hundred million years of history
It's only coming down to you and me
Give me time and I'll make it up to you

Up, up
Thought you wanted to be up
Thought you wanted to be loved
Don't you want to be loved?

Reaching up to turn the clock around
It's like a ladder to my heart
A feeling that I got when I was young
Like the days, the days
Were folding up into my pocket
And honestly I wouldn't change a single thing about the time we had

Up, up
Thought you wanted to be up
Thought you wanted to be loved
Don't you want to be loved?
Don't you want to be

Up, up
Thought you wanted to be up
Thought you wanted to be loved
Don't you want to be loved?Looks like the sun has gone
Looks like the rain is here
Maybe we tried too hard
And what we had has disappeared
We gave it the same reaction
In between the heat and passion
But back in these distant plains
I only want to see your face

Come on, love
Come on, love
Just show your face
'Cause we're giving up
Come on, love
Come on, love
Release yourself
'Cause we've given enough

Come on, love
Come on, love
Just show your face
'Cause we're giving up
Come on, love
Come on, love
Release yourself
'Cause we've given enough

What are we asking
Asking to start again
This other world we're trapped in
Feels like it's coming to an end
Emergency lights are flashing
Against every wall we're crashing
Alone in these distant plains
I just want to see your face

Come on, love
Come on, love
Just show your face
'Cause we're giving up
Come on, love
Come on, love
Release yourself
'Cause we've given enough
We give our hearts, give our souls
Until some time we can all be home
So come on, love
Come on, love
Bring us back together now

So come on, love
Try and lift us higher
Our last hope, you know what to do
Come on, love
Even if you're tired
I'll stand by yours
Come on, love (woah)
Don't you, don't you forget about me
Don't you, don't you forget about us
Don't you, don't you forget about me
Forget about me, forget about us (Don't you, don't you)
Come on, love

Just show your face
'Cause we're giving up

So come, on, love (Don't you, don't you forget about me)
Come on, love
(Don't you, don't you forget about us)

Come on, love
Come on, love
Come on, love

Oh, come on, love
Come on
Say you'll be back some dayI've been drowning in the river
Tried to soothe my soul
Take me under, take me deeper
Than I choose to go
I can't see it any clearer
I said long ago
But down here underneath the surface
You're my only hope

If you remember me everyone else can forget
Everyone else can forget
Tell them I have nothing, nothing

'Cause I'd rather go blind
Than watch you walk out of my life
Turn my face up to the sky
You know we all, we all, we all, we all cry
Heart on the line for the love we left behind
I can't let you go this time
And oh I know, I know, I know you hear me
Cry, cry, cry
I know, I know, I know you hear me

I've been waiting for the storm
To surrender my soul
Bathe me in your holy water and lay me down

If you remember me everyone else can forget
Everyone else can forget
Tell them I have nothing, nothing

'Cause I'd rather go blind
Than watch you walk out of my life
Turn my face up to the sky

I thought I found love
With somebody else's girl, yeah
Ooh

Walkin 'round feeling so broken-hearted
Lost in a different world
Then you came in my life
Bought me back to reality someday
Now I don't need a fantasy

Deep in a sense of denial
But then you rescued me baby
Opened my eyes and made me see you babe

Don't be sold a dream
Remember how the past has been 
Don't be led to believe this one's for you 
Calculate your needs
I see there's room to plant your seeds 
Don't decide |til you see how the others have grown 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in, oh no
Once you've tasted love 

Still too early to know
Give them time and they will grow 
Don't believe that the first's the one for you 
Most will grow to be tall
Others will break and fall 
Keep your eye on the strongest head of them all 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning

What's an hour of the day 
We throw at least one away 
And walk the streets for half the year 
To try to find a new career 
If you get a flu attack 
For thirty days you're on your back 
Doing not a single dance 
Baby give me half a chance 

It only takes a minute girl (only takes a minute girl)
To fall in love, to fall in love (to fall in love)

To fall in love, to fall in love 

Now in the unemployment lines 
You can spend your life reading signs 
Waiting for your interview 
They can shoot the whole day for you 

Now winter's gonna turn to spring 
And you haven't accomplished a thing 
So baby can't you make me just a little time 
'Cause you never know what's on my mind

Ooh, ooh
Oh yeah
Put your head against my life 
What do you hear 
A million words just trying to make 
The love song of the year 
Close your eyes but don't forget 
What you have heard 
A man who's trying to say three words 
The words that make me scared 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
And here I am 
Here I am
A million love songs later
Here I am

Looking to the future now 
This is what I see 
A million chances pass me by 
A million chances to hold you 
Take me back, take me back 
To where I used to be 
To hide away from all my truth 
Through the light I see 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
Here I am
Just for you girl
A million love songs later
Here I am
I feel for you, babe
Feel for you baby
A million love songs later
Here I, here I amBaby I'm watching you to see 
I don't like the way you've been treating me 
I promised you nothing and gave you much more 
Making love is all you wanted me for 

You're never satisfied, you're never satisfied 
If you open your mind you'll see 
That you could be satisfied with me 

Baby you criticize my every move 
Look, can't you see I've nothing to prove 
I've had enough, it's a matter of time 
Maybe we'll make it somewhere down the line 

You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 
You can be if you wanna be 

I often wonder what I see in you 
You don't do the things that I want you to do 
I open my eyes and dream it's alright 
Maybe we'll make it together tonight
I'm tired of closing my eyes, to picture you in my mind 
It feels so cold to be alone 
Not sure where I want to be, so close to finding my dream 
We need to hold on to all the times we spoke of love 
Now I pray to God above that someday I can find the door 
I'm looking for 

I can make it, I know I can 
I can save this love forever 
I can make I know I can 
We can make this work together 

It's not a lonely men's dream,it's just that now that there's been 
A taste of love in my life 
That I refuse to return, I've got so much to learn 
How can it feels as though I've reached the top of this steep hill 
For a moment I was standing still 
Now I have the faith I've needed to believe 

'Cause you knop what this love means to me 
You know how it feels when I can see it in your face 
That you're missing me now, you feel I've let you down 
You've gotta hold on, you've gota reach out and believe 

I can make this world a place for me and you 
We can make it, we can make it together 
Do what you like, do what you like
Sugar sweet, if only they all knew 
Jam, can't spread no more you've took my bread 
Energy, just work, no rest or play

No need to ask me, do what you want 
Do what you like, do what you like 
No need to tell me, do what you want

Do what you likeStanding back I can't believe
How you've led me on 
And judging by the things you say 
There's gotta be something wrong 
 
What you telling me that for you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
I wanna know 

Seems that I've been playing your game 
And how you think you've won 
But when you count up what you've gained you're the lonely one 

What you telling me that for when you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time

I've closed the door to keep my love within

All I do each night is pray (Come on, time is running out)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (You and me)
All I do each night is think, of all the times (On my knees, you and me)
I've closed the door to keep my love within (On my knees)
All I do each night is pray (You and me, forever more)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)You've maybe seen me walk behind you 
I follow you just everywhere you go 
I've heard a whisper, they're telling me you've missed her 
I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

Even now I know it doesn't change me 
Maybe someday you'll be free again 
Till then remember, babe I won't surrender 
Still hurts me when I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

You said you've been missing me 
But how can that be girl, how can that be girl 
Now all our plans that used to be passing us by 
You say I want to be freeHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (come on, yeah), your love is my only desire (I need your love)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need, I need your love

Yeah, you got to be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah)
Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah
Strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side (on the other side)
And I got hope (hope) in my soul, I'll keep walkin' baby
Keep on walkin' baby

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire (only desire)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight me fire (relight my fire) relight my fire baby
Relight my fire (I need your love, yeah yeah)

Relight my fire (yeah yeah), your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your loveOh yeah
Baby 
Don't you want me to go 
So honey, why don't you beg me to stay 
For love, and talk the way we used to talk 
'Til we both know what we've lost 
Never say the words we did before 
When it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No no, love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away
To a town called yesterday 
Love (love) ain't here anymore 

Listen, oh listen, I don't wanna let go 
So maybe we can change the way we feel 
For love, and open up the way we did before 
Now is the right time 
And I'm sure you'd never say the words you did before
Well, it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
No, no love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away, to a town called yesterday 
Love (love) don't live here anymore (ooh no no no)

And when I find a place for me to keep my sweet love (keep my sweet love)
Then I will leave it there forever more, yeah 
And when I find someone to share I'll never give up 
I will hold you and believe that this life leads to more 

Oh, love 
No no no
No no no, well it was over
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore (it's gone away, it's gone away, to a town called yesterday)
Love ain't here anymore (don't you beg me to stay, no no no)
Love ain't here anymoreYou came to me, baby 
And I though that I saw love in your eyes 
But all the promises you made were not to be 
I should have seen through your disguise 

Oh no baby you know you always tried 
Make me look the fool, what's goin' on 
You used to be so good to me now what is wrong 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

What has happened to you lately 
I don't sense that lovin', feelin' anymore 
Every time you bring me down I want to cry 
Do you want to see me walkin' out that door 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Oh no baby you know you're always trying 
To make me look the fool 
Won't you tell me why you hurt me 
Is this the love has got to be 
No baby, I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 

Tell me why you want to hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for meI'm mad at you, because af all the things you do 
I want you to see the way your games are hurting me 
So why did I ever fall in love with you 
You're all of my nightmares and dreams come true 

What can I do to make you talk this problem through 
You said you've nothing to hide 
So let me hear your feelings inside 
I never dreamed that I'd see this kind of thing in my life 
So baby, please let me go, let me go 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

All I can see are staring eyes of mystery 
I've tried to look behind before you take my dignity and pride 
We sit and talk all night, still you never seem to lose your height 
You believe in yourself, I hope I'm never gonna need your help 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

You don't want me, you don't need me, I got news now 
'cause baby I'm watching you 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours tooDeceit and lies, is all I've taken 
Let me surface to breath 
No sacrifice, no inspiration 
Can you understand me? 

Why should I ask you, 
Why should I worry? 
You never worry about me 
Why should I ned you, 
Why don't I let you go? 
And let my heartaches run free 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 

What's on my mind, so many questions 
Though the answers I can guess 
You slip away shelter from confrontation 
Look my life is such a mess 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now open wide 
You hurt my mind, you hurt my soul 
Never believing what I'm saying 
I'll hunt you down, I'll make you mine 
You'll be the game I've started playing 
And if you won't be there I will know where you're going 
And if you won't be there I will try everyway of showing you that 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I need 

You understand, you realize 
The scene that I'm creating 
And all the while you compromise 
On the liberties I'm taking 
If you don't believe I want just you and I together 
Then you won't believe the dream of you and I forever because 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I needI am just one man with his one pair of eyes 
I dress in normal clothes and I don't try to disguise 
I'm looking out for love however it may seem 
I never do return in the always winning team 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heart 

I had my spills and thrills of love 
And held it in my hand 
I held on tight until it broke 
And I crashed to the ground 
Love cannot be on my side 
It's clearer every dull 
That every time I reach for love 
It always runs away 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heartIt's good to be near you, even though I'm alone 
Reviving memories of our happy home 
No sign of sunlight since you ran away 
These rooms get darker now every day 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

The consequences of freedom 
But now you have what you dreamed 
Just understand that things are not as they seem 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me? 

I don't want to be lonely 
Because you're not there for me to be 
I don't want to be lonely 
I want to be loved 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me? 
Will you still love me?I come to your door to see you again,
But where you once stood was an old man instead
I asked where you'd be, he said she's moved, on you see
All I have is a number you'd better ask her not me
So I picked up the phone and dialed your number
Not sure to put it down or speak
Then a voice I once knew answered in a sweet voice
She said hello then paused before I began to speak

Babe I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

You held your voice well, there were tears I could tell
But where were you now, was you gonna tell me in time?
Just give me a town and I'll be straight down
I've got so much to tell you about where I have been
As I walk down your road, can't wait to be near you
I can't keep the feeling in inside (I, I, I can't keep it inside)
As I stand at your door you answered in a sweet voice
You said hello then pause before I begin to speak

Babe (Babe), I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

As I looked away, I saw a face behind you
A little boy stood at your door
And as I looked again I saw his face was shining
He had my eyes (My eyes), he had my smile (my smile)

Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), please take me back (I'm back again)
Take me back (Babe)
Back here again
Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
Can't you see that I'm back again (Babe)
I'm here for you (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), just me and you (I'm back again)
You and me (Babe)
OohSure, so sure
Sure, so sure
Feel it, move it, feel it, move back
Need you so much, yeah, yeah
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

Sitting here runnin' to my lover (lover)
Last time we met, I wasn't to sure (not so sure)
Now I'm hoping, maybe dreaming, for a life as one
When she reads this I'm hoping she'll call (call me baby)
I need more much, more than before
I need positive reactions, whenever I'm down

'Cause I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking on my door
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

It's not a game, so don't play hard to get
Tired of running after you
There's no connections holding us down (down)
Isn't it a shame (shame), that it never happened (isn't it a shame), oh yeah
Though still here we are the second time round
It's gonna be social, compatible, sexual, irresistible
It's gotta be right for life

Now I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking at my door
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside, yeah
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found, yeah, yeah

Holdin', squeezin', touchin', teasin'
Wantin', wishin', waitin', thinkin'
Of your love, yeah yeah
Blindin', groovin', feel it, move it
Findin', breathin', bracin', breedin'
With you girl
It's gonna be social, compatible, sexual, irresistible
It's gotta be right for love

Sure, so sure, oh yeah
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found, yeah, yeah

I need you so much, yeah yeah, oh baby
Sure, so sure, so sure that it's sweet love I foundI guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong (whenever I'm wrong)
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back (want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good
Oh yeah

I guess now it's time that you came back for goodEvery guy needs a girl like you, 
Every girl needs a guy like me, oh yeah 
Every guy needs a guy like you, like you 
See cause that's how it's meant to be 

OK so I've stared a little long 
You can take my body, take my fingers and my tongue 
Oh you move like you know what's coming next 
Touching me, touching you, touching all around your legs

Shall I come over, shall I wait a little more?

See cause that's how it's meant to beMonday morning and the feeling's still the same 
It's our Sunday through our Saturday love 
This ain't no weekend thing this ain't no teenage game 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 

I have no reason to be feeling kind of strange 
But I guess that's just the man that I am 
In the clouds, in my dreams in pouring rain 
Hand in hand, under this rainbow we can always still the same 

It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our Sunday through to Saturday loveMaking my way through photographs 
Of the night when you first stood by my side 
Old friends with smiles some are here some are gone 
Good memories of our senior high 
Looking back we're the only couple still together 
Even then I knew this love would be forever, I knew 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

Our lives have all changed we've come a long long way 
Our faces show the lines of two young songs 
And in their houses there will be pictures 
Like the ones of you and me 
Hope they can look back and smile just like we have done 
Never once have I felt the need for another 
We were strong and survived the storm in time to discover 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

All of the smiles we have won 
Just from looking back and reliving all the good times 
And when we've been through all the pages 
We just start again, oh 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you
We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
Tudutu
We've had success (tudutu), we've had good times (tudutu)
But remember this (tudutu)

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there

With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realized what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I look so high you don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of "I can't explain this feeling" now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I made
The fact of reality (oh)

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for more
But remember this

We're not invincible, we're not invincible, no
We're only people, we're only people
Hey we're not invincible, we're not invincible
So again I tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, never forget where
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream (woah)
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing, oh baby
Never, no never, never forget for love
Someday, louder, louder, louder, louder loud

Oh (woah)
Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, louder now
Someday, come on, come on, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody (woah)Can we talk, thoughout the night I need you so bad 
And when we talk can you understand my feelings 
And understand it hurts to be without you 

Never prepared, never know what's going wrong 
I'm loosing though, I always thought this love was so strong 
So alone, so lost in the dark, 
So hurt, cause you will always have a place in my heart 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love, I need it 

Let's take a walk and reminisce about 
The feelings we used to feel 
Just stay the word and I'll be back for good my baby 
I'll be back to give you girl what you deserve 

Don't say too much, did I try to rule your life 
Did the love we had between us 
Miss the road to paradise 
Can we try again, can we chance it one more time 
Can the ecstasy we found here 
Be re-claimed as yours and mine 

Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your love 
Hangin' onto your loveI kind of keep asking myself little questions 
Like where do I go from here 
I seem to keep loosing track of time and how long it's been 
Since I last had you near 

Been a painful road to a door that's closed 
Been a gamble that I knew I couldn't win 
Been a lonely conversation to this photograph of you 
In the mirror there's a sing I must give in 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you 

I used to enjoy spending my time on my own here 
Watching the jaded people pass 
Now here I am sharing their pain and their lonely tears 
And walking a road of broken glass 

It's a constant fight to get through each day and night 
It's a war between the present and the past 
And the face that's in your mind every time you close your eyes 
What's the reason, what's the answer, how long will this last 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 

Been a long time since I heard your last goobdye 
Still I hear it clearly every day and night 
What's the point in love when you have to give it up 
Yet still you need it and it's nowhere you can find 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you   
Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

This is the time I feel it 
Here in the middle of the night 
Still wide awake and feeling cheated 
From a girl I thought was treating me right 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

Gotta get away from the feelings I had 
Be real you won't be seeing her again 
It's complicated when you're feeling so bad 
And your girl is still walking away 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true Only one way to describe, this is deceit I am hiding 
Never been here before, never wanna see here again 
I've strayed from a long term lover 
And found greater lust from another 
My conscience is keeping me awake and shouting at me all night 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Being loved is a big responsibility, 
You can never give too much back 
You know it's so easy to walk away and leave that lady flat 
My life's feeling crowded with possessions, am I lucky or sad 
Is it time to turn away and lose everything I had 

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 

Moving in circles, decisions chasing me round and round 
Why's life never easy, or do we make it hard for ourselves 
And when we find love we need to look for something new 
'Cos when it's all over, you always feel the need to be loved 
Like she always loved you 
If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt
Will we lose this chance again?
Strange roads with different signs
Don't even know where we divide
Are you my enemy or my friend?

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

We all grieve in different ways
If one tear could wash away the pain
We're all free to have the faith we believe, yeah
The world sleeps at different times
With one turn your day is now my night
We all live sharing the air that we breathe

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

If our arms were reaching out
If our words could only bridge the doubt

Cause I don't know you
And you don't know me
It's the same sun rising
We all just look to the sky
If we try
We can work it out somehow
If you don't know me
And I don't know you
How can we be fighting
We're all connected it's true
Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us through

Reaching out, reaching high
Reaching out
Touching you, touching me

Reaching out
It's only love that pulls us throughJust have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
That any minute all the pain will stop

Just hold, me close
Inside, your arms, tonight
Don't be to hard on my emotions

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patience

I really wanna start over again
I know you wanna be my salvation
The one that I can always depend
I'll try to be strong, believe me
I'm trying to move on
It's complicated but understand me

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have little patience yeah
Have a little patience yeah

'Cause the scars run so deep
It's been hard, but I have to believe

Have a little patience
Have a little patience

Oh, 'cause I
I just need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I"m still healing
Just try
And have a little patience
Have a little patience
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patienceHere standing in the rain 
The sun has gone again and nothing's gonna change 
Time, I need a little time
As you slip out of sight 
And nothing heals the pain 

And I know that it's you
That's stopping me from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground
'Til I see you again
And you know

[Chorus]
The sun will shine, and we will see
There's nothing standing in our way 
Love will stand and never break 
I never thought this could be me 
Do you feel what I feel
Every time that you are near it's a beautiful world 
A beautiful world 

Words are hard to keep inside 
Even though I've tried, impossible to hide 
And you know that it's me
That's stopping you from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground 
'Til I see you again 
And you know

[Chorus]

I'll be the stars guiding you 
I'll be the place that you hide 
I'd run a thousand miles, a thousand miles
To be by your side

[Chorus]We've been many times before
Leaving rooms and slamming doors
We're climbing up the bedroom walls
Sometimes we make it so frustrating
I touch your mouth, I touch your lips
The answers are our fingertips
Not giving up or giving in
Why are we so complicated?

Oh tell me what to say, tell me
To make it all OK, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna see you hurting
Just hold on
Just hold on to me
I don't wanna see you crying
So hold on
So hold on to me

I'm trying to think of what to do
To really make it up to you
So many truths, too many lies
Making love can be so crazy
I find myself back here again
Asking you to let me in
You know it's time, we need to change
How can we live with all these maybes?

There are no words that say, no words
To make it go away

[Chorus]

Cause baby it's alright
I'm staying here tonight
So hold on

Just tell me what to say
To let you know
I'll always stayWhere, where are the stars?
The one that we used to call ours
Can't imagine it now
We used to laugh til we fell down

The secrets we had, now in the past
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

Now you're so far away
And I see our stars is fading
One too many times
Guess it just got tired of waiting around

The night that we thought, if these walls could talk
From something to nothing, tell me

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you

So now does he give you love
Oh, Is it only me now that's thinking of, what we had and what we were
Oh, Did you ever care, baby was I ever there?

How did we lose our way?
It's hard to remember, all that we shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone
Tell me how, did we lose our way
It's hard to remember, all that we've shared
Now we both have separate lives
From lovers to strangers, now alone

There's no one catching my fall
No one to hear my call
It's like I never loved you at all

It's like I never loved you at all [Repeat: x2]You, you're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, so come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Stop (stop)
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile

Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, oh come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Hey, let me know ya (let me know ya)
You're all that matters to me (you're all that matters to me)
Hey, let me show ya (let me show ya)
You're all that matters to me (you're all that matters to me)

So come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine

Hey, let me know ya (let me know ya)

(Oh, come on yeah)
Let it shine
Just let it shine
(Shine all your light over me)
ShineThere's a place we used to be
There's a face that I used to see
There's a picture with you by my side
There's a moment that I want to find.

I don't know where to start
Or how to begin
But I know I love you still.

If you ever turn away
If you ever change your mind
If the road ahead becomes too hard to climb
If there's something in your heart that tells you to stop
Oh to hold you close tonight
I'd wait for life.

There's a voice shouting inside my head
There's a space on your side of the bed
There's a hope every time there's a sound
There's a silence that's playing too loud

I don't know how you are
Or how you may be
But I know I love you still.

If I close my eyes
I'll dream a little deeper baby
Cause you are always on my mind
Yeah you are always on my mind
For life.I'm afraid of the morning
I'm afraid of the light
You should come with a warning
You should be wearing a sign
That says you're beautiful trouble
So you better beware
One look and I was in right over my head.

Oh this misery
There's no place on earth I'd rather be.

You're not the one I need
You're just the one that I want
Makes a perfect sense to me
You're not the one I need
But you're the one that I want
Ain't no sense of love.

I try to stop myself
So many times
But I keep falling over
I keep crossing the line
The heart of a gypsy and the soul of a stone
It's just a matter of time before you leave ma alone.

Oh sweet misery
Fill my heart up and pour it all over me.

It's not logical
That's the way I feel
It's not logical
Psychological
It's heaven underneath my skin but it's hell out here.What am I to you and what are you to me?
Are we getting better or did we used to be?
What of the song we used to sing?
Where are the souls we used to carry in?
What is a sail without hurricane?
What is a hurt without someone to blame?
Show me the sky and I'll climb the stairs
Give me something 'cause I'm losing it.

Give me what it is you believe in
Cause I give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay.

Tell me the word and I'll shout it out
For what is a voice when in doubt?
The world has changed
The world will change
Oh give me something cause I need to feel.

It's so good you know
I still love you so
And you don't have to do this on your own.
No, noWe used to walk Mancunian Way
We used to swagger we used to sway
Up until the lights took us away
Do you know what you meant to me?
We used to think we were the bomb
Then someone left a real one
We stayed indoors as the rain come
Back then it made no sense to me
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall they gave us the keys to the cit, but they don't fit anything
But I'm coming away.

I hear you calling
I came back running
Forgot that feeling
Been so log coming
They tried to stop her
She just got stronger
I'm driving home again
Back down Mancunian Way

I just forgot how it is to feel
To dance and move and keep it real
Been lying down foot ten long years
But I was there and it feels like yesterday
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall you came when I was pretty, but that don't work no more
But I'm coming anyway.

Now I stand here in front of you
I know now what I'm gonna do
My shoulders low, but my head is high
I'm gonna bring this town alive
Through this acidic rain
I'm gonna come back to life again.A little boy me went fishing in a wooden boat
Sitting there for hours in the cold
Patience is a virtue til we die
Then a ripple in the water caught my eye.

Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for
That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor
We go from green to blue to go to black
Breathe deep, who knows how long will this last.

Only was last week I learnt to drive
Stole my mother's keys and drove all night
Christine never showed it's 4 am
Started up mum's car drove home again.

One year ago I kissed my bride
Now I wait to hear my baby's cry
Woman showed me all that she knew then
To cut himself down man's born again.

Christine died and now I'm here alone
What I wouldn't give to be on that wooden boat.And the fishermen came back across the water 
And the people started running in the park 
And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms 
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us 
And the scent of burning oil was in the air 
And the music played 
And it felt so good to hear 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking 
As the tear from every cloud begin to fall 
For one moment then, we understood it all 

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming 
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women 
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter 
So come on, let me love you 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 
This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon 
A million people walking back to work 
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

You and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah, the gardenToday this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Let's make a new start
The future is ours to find
Can you see it, can you see it in my eyes
Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on (tonight)
Hold on
Hold on

Oh stay close to me (hold on)
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close me

Oh, hold your head high (hold on)
Arms open wide
Yea the world starts to come alive when you stay close it me

Today this could be the greatest day of our lives
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives

Oh and the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
Oh, oh, oh
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive) hold on
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive)
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me (hold on)
Oh (stay close to me) and the world comes alive
(Stay close to me) and the world
Watch the world come alive tonight
(Stay close to me) oh oh oh ohI'd watch the world go by in the morning
Lose myself in the the news
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I don't notice

I'd write a long love song with no meaning
And hope nobody would hear
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming

Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

I'd lock myself away in the evening
Afraid to ever come out
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings

Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh
HelloWhen the tears fall away
And there's no conversation
There's nothing left to break
That's not already broken
You're staring into space
And every inch of silence
Been standing here for days, and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

In the sudden light of day
The weight of expectation
Hurt begins to fade
As you find a new direction
Been talking here for days and days and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we said it all?Julie, what's your problem?
Won't you tell me, what's going on?
Cause there's a dark cloud, hanging over you.
You've been down, down, down too long.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside, and they're playing now, for you, for you.

Julie, come to your window.
Don't let your problems, spoil the view.
It's not a good thing, to cry today.
So come on change change change, come through the door.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now for you.
You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now for you, for you.

Why why why do you cry cry cry?
You should know by now that the sun comes up for you.
Why why why do you cry cry cry?
You should know now that the sun comes up for you, that the sun comes up for you.

You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now, for you, for you.
You used to sing sha lalalalala I want you, sing, sha lalalalala I do.
There's a band outside and they're playing now, for you, for you.
Sha lalalalala I want you, sha lalalalala I do.Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And I'm going round in circles every day
The more I shout the more I hesitate
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Stand up please til I'm done losing my mind
And I've thanked you all just one too many times
The more we fall the harder we must climb
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Cause everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say, to say

Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And before the music takes you all away
I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to say

I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to sayJust the other day somebody said to me
"Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But jokes aside, I can explain
It's just my way of keeping track
With living on this planet now then

Have you turned on your TV
Have you seen reality
Have you seen a program that you've spent your whole life looking for
There's a girl in Camden town
Indecision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smile at me

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

All the noises and all these lights
All these talking through the nights
All these expectation now
It's making me neurotic
Tell me, have you seen your face before
I forgot to say 'hello'
Thought I'd make it clear now
That I've always been a smiler, tell me
 
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

Sometimes it's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody said to me
"Hey maybe you are oh so slightly OCD
A little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But, jokes aside, please stay with me
It's just my way of compartmentalizing all the things I see

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to thisSometimes I see your face looking at me
All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope I've got wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

I met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"
He met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe (oh maybe) I don't need you to save me (I don't need you to save me)
I just want you to help me (I just want you to help me)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night (Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you'll stayIs it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose to for my valentine? 
What is love? 

Is it only words? 
I'm trying to find? 
Or is it the way, that we're feeling now? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

A pain or a cure? 
A science of faith? 
A reason to fall to your knees and die? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

Only you can save me now. 
Only you can heal me now. 
Only you can show me now, 
What is love. 

Or is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
What is love?Take a piece of
me and throw the rest away (throw it all away)

My lips are moving but you don't hear a word I say (nothing left
to say)

Everybody loves a mystery, everybody needs a reason to believe
Everybody has a history, everybody's hiding something up their
...(sleeve)

sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at all
Play your little game, I'll look the other way (just look the
other way)

everybody wants the sunshine, everybody is a friend of mine
sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at all
Take a closer look inside, take a closer look inside
sometimes life's such a drag when you don't know what you have
If I'm only a reflection on the wall, Kaleidoscope dividing
you don't know me, you don't know me at allYou can dance if you like 
You can sing every line of every song 
No, you don't have to steal the show 
It was your show all along 

As the orchestra plays 
The people take the seats 
There's no room left in this house 
Its only you and me 
And if life is your stage 
I'll be watching 

[Chorus]
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
Ill be watching 
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
And I'll be watching you. 

Everything that you do 
As we start, rehearsing every scene 
The words to everything 
We realize that the crowd is listening 
And then the tears, fall down on your face 
In exactly the right place

[Chorus]Up and down 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see me down life's highway 

Not black or white 
As crystal clear as a cloudy night 
Traveling in the name of lonely 
I was only home when you held me 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to. 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear. 

Flying home tonight 
As far away as a satellite 
Keeping your heart in my pocket 
Hope to God that I don't drop it 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come bursting through my door 

And it's here, 

where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear 
I hear 

Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time to come home 
Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time 

Up and down, 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see my down life's highway 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to 
Is here 
All the things I keep so dear I hear 

Everybody's talking now 
Everybody's walking 'round 
Everybody's dreaming 'boutI'd watch the world go by in the morning
Lose myself in the the news
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I don't notice

I'd write a long love song with no meaning
And hope nobody would hear
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming

Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

I'd lock myself away in the evening
Afraid to ever come out
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings

Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh
HelloWhen the time grew near, for me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for, hidin' from a word
I need to hear now, don't think I'll hear it again (Don't think I'll hear it again)

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (Woah)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Oh yeah)
All I do each night is think (Oh yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within (Closed the door)

If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

But the nights were always warm with you (My love)
Holding you right by my side (Right by my side)
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (Close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray (All I do each night is pray)
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday (Down on my knees)
All I do each night is think (Yeah), of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight (Woah)
Of the dream we long to live (We long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times
I've closed the door to keep my love within

All I do each night is pray (Come on, time is running out)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (You and me)
All I do each night is think, of all the times (On my knees, you and me)
I've closed the door to keep my love within (On my knees)
All I do each night is pray (You and me, forever more)
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday (That's what I told you)I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong (whenever I'm wrong)
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back (want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good
Oh yeah

I guess now it's time that you came back for goodWe've come so far
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young
And we hope for more

We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
We've had success
We've had good times
But remember this

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there
With danger on my mind
I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realised what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I looked so high I don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of I can't explain this feeling now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I make
And the fact of reality

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far 
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young 
And we hope for more
But remember this
We're not invincible
We're not invincible, no (we're not invincible)
We're only people (ooh)
We're only people (we're not invincible)
Hey we're not invincible (we're not invincible)
We're not invincible
So again I'll tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never (ooh, hoo, hoo) (never! Never! Never!)
Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing ooh baby
Never, no never
Never forget, oh, no
Someday
Louder, louder, louder, louder loud
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, loud now
Someday, come on, come on
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody

Never forget where you're coming from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for moreHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (come on, yeah), your love is my only desire (I need your love)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need, I need your love

Yeah, you got to be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah)
Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah
Strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side (on the other side)
And I got hope (hope) in my soul, I'll keep walkin' baby
Keep on walkin' baby

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire (only desire)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight me fire (relight my fire) relight my fire baby
Relight my fire (I need your love, yeah yeah)

Relight my fire (yeah yeah), your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your loveYou can dance if you like 
You can sing every line of every song 
No, you don't have to steal the show 
It was your show all along 

As the orchestra plays 
The people take the seats 
There's no room left in this house 
Its only you and me 
And if life is your stage 
I'll be watching 

[Chorus]
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
Ill be watching 
Hold up a light for me [Repeat x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
And I'll be watching you. 

Everything that you do 
As we start, rehearsing every scene 
The words to everything 
We realize that the crowd is listening 
And then the tears, fall down on your face 
In exactly the right place

[Chorus]Today this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Let's make a new start
The future is ours to find
Can you see it, can you see it in my eyes
Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on (tonight)
Hold on
Hold on

Oh stay close to me (hold on)
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close me

Oh, hold your head high (hold on)
Arms open wide
Yea the world starts to come alive when you stay close it me

Today this could be the greatest day of our lives
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives

Oh and the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
Oh oh oh
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive) hold on
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive)
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me (hold on)
Oh (stay close to me) and the world comes alive
(Stay close to me) and the world
Watch the world come alive tonight
(Stay close to me) oh oh oh ohAnd the fishermen came back across the water 
And the people started running in the park 
And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms 
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us 
And the scent of burning oil was in the air 
And the music played 
And it felt so good to hear 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking 
As the tear from every cloud begin to fall 
For one moment then, we understood it all 

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming 
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women 
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter 
So come on, let me love you 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your mind and start living 
We can play a part if we only start believing 
This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon 
A million people walking back to work 
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden 

This is the life we've been given 
So open your heart and start loving 
We can make a start if we only learn to listen 

You and me, we just lay down in the garden 
Yeah, the gardenYou, you're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, so come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine

Stop (stop)
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile

Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, oh come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine

(Shine)
Oh come on (hey)
See the light on your face
(Oh, come on yeah)
Let it shine
Just let it shine
(Shine all your light over me)
ShineSometimes I see your face looking at me
All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope I've got wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

I met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"
He met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe (oh maybe) I don't need you to save me (I don't need you to save me)
I just want you to help me (I just want you to help me)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night (Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you'll stayJust the other day somebody said to me
"Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But jokes aside, I can explain
It's just my way of keeping track
With living on this planet now then

Have you turned on your TV
Have you seen reality
Have you seen a program that you've spent your whole life looking for
There's a girl in Camden town
Indecision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smile at me

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

All the noises and all these lights
All these talking through the nights
All these expectation now
It's making me neurotic
Tell me, have you seen your face before
I forgot to say 'hello'
Thought I'd make it clear now
That I've always been a smiler, tell me
 
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this

Sometimes it's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody said to me
"Hey maybe you are oh so slightly OCD
A little out of reach, my friend"
I said "yes, that's partly true"
But, jokes aside, please stay with me
It's just my way of compartmentalizing all the things I see

How did it come to this
How did it ever come to this
How did it come to this
How did it ever come to thisSilence please 'cause I've got something to say
And I'm going round in circles every day
The more I shout the more I hesitate
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Stand up please til I'm done losing my mind
And I've thanked you all just one too many times
The more we fall the harder we must climb
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Cause everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say, to say

Silence please 'cause I've got something to say
And before the music takes you all away
I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to say

I never thought I'd leave it all so late
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone

Yeah, everybody loves a circus show
But I'm the only clown you'll ever know
And now you can applaud my best mistake
I love you was too many words to say
I love you was too many words to say, to sayIs it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose to for my valentine? 
What is love? 

Is it only words? 
I'm trying to find? 
Or is it the way, that we're feeling now? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

A pain or a cure? 
A science of faith? 
A reason to fall to your knees and die? 
What is love? 

If love is truth, then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 

Only you can save me now. 
Only you can heal me now. 
Only you can show me now, 
What is love. 

Or is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
What is love?When the tears fall away
And there's no conversation
There's nothing left to break
That's not already broken
You're staring into space
And every inch of silence
Been standing here for days, and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

In the sudden light of day
The weight of expectation
Hurt begins to fade
As you find a new direction
Been talking here for days and days and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we said it all?Just have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
That any minute all the pain will stop

Just hold, me close
Inside, your arms, tonight
Don't be to hard on my emotions

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patience

I really wanna start over again

The one that I can always depend

It's complicated but understand me

Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing

At the start of whatever,
Shouting love at the world.
Back then, we were like cavemen,
But we map the moon and the stars,
Then we forgave them.

We will meet you where the lights are,
The defenders, of the faith we are.
Where the thunder turns around
They'll run so hard we'll tear the ground away.

You know no one dies,
In these love drowned eyes,
Through our love drowned eyes,
We'll watch you sleep tonight.

Although no one understood
We were holding back the flood,
Learning how to dance the rain.
We were holding back the flood
They said we'd never dance again.

Bleeding, but none of us leaving,
Watch your mouth son or you'll find yourself floating home.
Here we come now on a dark star,
Seeing demons, not what we are.

Tiny minds and eager hands
Will try to strike but now will end today.

There's progress now where there once was none,
Where there once was none, then everything came along.

Although no one understood,
We were holding back the flood learning how to dance the rain.
There was more of them than us now they'll never dance again.

Youth don't leave me, hair stay on me
God I love those hips
Oh memory don't forsake me
Not like this

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectible, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things

They're still out there somewhere
Making men feel this way
At fallen Broadway station
I see them every day, all day

Download a little meditation
It might pull you through
She blinded me with silence
Anchored here with you

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things

There's a surge in my psychosis every turn of the screw
And I'm half awake in paisley print.
I can see the world clearly but I have to squint.
I am a supersonic specimen.
A minor miracle of medicine
I'm at the mercy of unwanted emotions.
Where nothing matters, beneath my thoughts
Beneath my thoughts is where it happens.
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements, replace me
Was it a positive experiment?
To be indefinitely decadent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I'm at the back of the club and so afraid to speak
Cos I'm not like these people
And these people are not like me
Super heavy elements, upgrade me
Supersonic elements amaze me
Your opinion is irrelevant
I was built to be magnificent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I haven't scratched the surface of my desire
In the world of dreams, I'm a frequent flier
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements,

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I'm feeling immortal
We'll live forever now
We'll live forever nowI, I'm just a piece of your pie chart 
You're in a room with a rock star 
Only I play the good parts of a kind heart 
The sky's too low and the room's too dark 
But she just carries on 
And I get her in but her friend gets turned away 
But what can I say? 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
You might be good looking, 
But you can't sleep with yourself tonight 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 

Oh I, I wish that beggars were choosers 
Unload my love like a looter 
I need some gas and a kick start, for a good heart 
The lighting's cheap, and the room is cold 
But she just carries on 
And you'll get no sleep 
But you might be turned away 
So what will you say? 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
You might be good looking, 
But you can't sleep with yourself tonight 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
If you're so good looking 
Why don't you sleep with yourself tonight? 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
You've gotta get it while you can 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a manMy greatest fear is we're just wasting tears
Wasting several years, still being round here
My greatest fear is maybe you will notice
I'm not what you wanted after all these years

But I, I've got a very big hope for us
I'm gonna keep looking up for us
It's been a difficult year
And I, I still wanna make love with you
So where do we go from here?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I still think I belong with you,
I still wanna belong to you
So what do you want from me
What do you want from me now?

Your greatest fear is we're not getting wiser,
We're not wise at all
It's getting harder, harder to recover
From the night before, when you turn me on
But I, I like to think of us moving on
I like to think of us getting on
So answer me where do we go from here,
Where do we go?

Because I, I still wanna get old with you
I still want us to grow
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I still think I'm in love with you
I still feel you're the one
So what do you want from me,
What do you want from me now?

Has it crossed your mind we might already know?
If we only let it go?

Yeah I, I still wanna have sex with you
I still wanna go out with you
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I think some days we're beautiful
I think some days we're not
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?

Let's make it positive
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?
We're making progress here, so where shall we go?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?My greatest fear is we're just wasting tears
Wasting several years, still being round here
My greatest fear is maybe you will notice
I'm not what you wanted after all these years

Let's make it positive
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?
We're making progress here, so where shall we go?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?It's just a fraction of time,
Until we move into reverse,
Can feel the pressure and all the minds,
And the whole Universe.
Is it a question of force,
And a physical law,
We've had this battle a thousand times,
Never been here before,
Never been here before.

Haven't got the strength to fight anymore,
Got no desire to die anymore,

I want to see you again, again, again,
Haven't got the strength to fight anymore,
Don't even know what I'm fighting forWe became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned
Expendable soldiers smiling at anything
Raised on a feeling our lives would have meaning eventually

We were once the answer and then you discover
You're actually just one thing after another
And what was the question and why was the lesson so deafening?

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And outside forces didn't make it easy
So I thought I'd go before you leave me
Self-preservation was no explanation for anything

But the truth is more than we'll ever comprehend
I'm just starting to understand, my friend
All of that distance, 'cause I fell in love with the enemy

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

At last, we meet on no man's land
Just footprints in the sand
We meet on no man's land, at last

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

One meaning
Just one meaningDarling please forgive me
I was sitting on the fence
I was slowly going out of head
I did not hear a word that you said
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbed

If I could take your blows, If I could get pass go,
If I could find a way of fixing the things that I broke
Then I would, if I could
And I might understand now I ended outta mind
And I might understand now I ended outta mind

But the truth is hard to find
When it's playing tricks with your mind
Darling please forgive me
I was hanging with my friends
I was slowly getting outta my head

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all?
The Good, the Bad, the Ugly or the Beautiful

Because it's up hill and against the wind
With no-one there to let us in
Leave your thoughts and save yourself you fool

The daggers of science
Evolving into violence
We're not sure where the fallout blows
But we all know ·

Grip like a new york window cleaner
Just staring at you

Youth don't leave me, hair stay on me
God I love those hips
Oh memory don't forsake me
Not like this

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectible, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things

They're still out there somewhere
Making men feel this way
At fallen Broadway station
I see them every day, all day

Download a little meditation
It might pull you through
She blinded me with silence
Anchored here with you

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectible, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things

All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectible, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things

Does she talk like ooh ooh ooh
Will it feel like ah ah ah
Does she tell you what she wants
Can you give her what she needs

Youth don't leave me, hair stay on me, god I love those hips

There's a surge in my psychosis every turn of the screw
And I'm half awake in paisley print.
I can see the world clearly but I have to squint.
I am a supersonic specimen.
A minor miracle of medicine
I'm at the mercy of unwanted emotions.
Where nothing matters, beneath my thoughts
Beneath my thoughts is where it happens.
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements, replace me
Was it a positive experiment?
To be indefinitely decadent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I'm at the back of the club and so afraid to speak
Cos I'm not like these people
And these people are not like me
Super heavy elements, upgrade me
Supersonic elements amaze me
Your opinion is irrelevant
I was built to be magnificent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I haven't scratched the surface of my desire
In the world of dreams, I'm a frequent flier
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements,

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I'm feeling immortal
We'll live forever now
We'll live forever nowI, I'm just a piece of your pie chart 
You're in a room with a rock star 
Only I play the good parts of a kind heart 
The sky's too low and the room's too dark 
But she just carries on 
And I get her in but her friend gets turned away 
But what can I say? 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
You might be good looking, 
But you can't sleep with yourself tonight 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 

Oh I, I wish that beggars were choosers 
Unload my love like a looter 
I need some gas and a kick start, for a good heart 
The lighting's cheap, and the room is cold 
But she just carries on 
And you'll get no sleep 
But you might be turned away 
So what will you say? 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
You might be good looking, 
But you can't sleep with yourself tonight 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 

When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy 
And the boy thinks the girl's all right 
Get your head out the library 
Get the courage of the cavalry 
If you're so good looking 
Why don't you sleep with yourself tonight? 
Oh what a beast, oh what a man 
You've gotta get it while you can 
You've gotta get it while you can 
You've gotta get it while you can 
Oh what a beast, oh what a manMy greatest fear is we're just wasting tears
Wasting several years, still being round here
My greatest fear is maybe you will notice
I'm not what you wanted after all these years

But I, I've got a very big hope for us
I'm gonna keep looking up for us
It's been a difficult year
And I, I still wanna make love with you
So where do we go from here?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I still think I belong with you,
I still wanna belong to you
So what do you want from me
What do you want from me now?

Your greatest fear is we're not getting wiser,
We're not wise at all
It's getting harder, harder to recover
From the night before, when you turn me on
But I, I like to think of us moving on
I like to think of us getting on
So answer me where do we go from here,
Where do we go?

Because I, I still wanna get old with you
I still want us to grow
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I still think I'm in love with you
I still feel you're the one
So what do you want from me,
What do you want from me now?

Has it crossed your mind we might already know?
If we only let it go?

Yeah I, I still wanna have sex with you
I still wanna go out with you
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I think some days we're beautiful
I think some days we're not
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?

Let's make it positive
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?
We're making progress here, so where shall we go?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?It's just a fraction of time,
Until we move into reverse,
Can feel the pressure and all the minds,
And the whole Universe.
Is it a question of force,
And a physical law,
We've had this battle a thousand times,
Never been here before,
Never been here before.

Haven't got the strength to fight anymore,
Got no desire to die anymore,

I want to see you again, again, again,
Haven't got the strength to fight anymore,
Don't even know what I'm fighting forWe became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned
Expendable soldiers smiling at anything
Raised on a feeling our lives would have meaning eventually

We were once the answer and then you discover
You're actually just one thing after another
And what was the question and why was the lesson so deafening?

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And outside forces didn't make it easy
So I thought I'd go before you leave me
Self-preservation was no explanation for anything

But the truth is more than we'll ever comprehend
I'm just starting to understand, my friend
All of that distance, 'cause I fell in love with the enemy

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

At last, we meet on no man's land
Just footprints in the sand
We meet on no man's land, at last

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

One meaning
Just one meaningWhen we were young the world seemed so old
Careless and cold
We did what we were told in our lives
When we were young
Had the world by the tail
Good would prevail
Starships at sail
And none of us would fail in this life
Not when you're young

We were drawn to whoever could keep us together
And bound by the heavens above
And we tried to survive traveling at the speed of love

Woah when we were young
When we adored the fabulous
Woah when we were young
We were the foolish fearless
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
Woah when we were young

In a moment of grace
A long leap of faith
The still more glorious dawn awaits
It's my life
I'm here with the lovers

And we burned the bridges
We're crossing over
Just to see the firelight
And the innocent are getting over
Being old tonight

Woah when we were young
When everything was what it seemed
Woah when we were young
And everyday was how we dreamed
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
Woah when we were young

And when you look at yourself tonight
Are you someone you recognize?
You can take back what you've given away
But it must be the last time

Woah when we were young
Woah when we were young
When we were young

Woah when we were young
When we adored the fabulous
Woah when we were young
We were the foolish fearless
Woah when we were young
We didn't know it wouldn't last
Woah when we were youngMan

You much too hard for me

The work is done
A place for everything til everything is in its place
And every setting sun
When the work was done
Was a day that didn't go to waste
When all the work is done
It will be done
Producing everything for everything to be replaced
And in dirty towns we will settle down
Manufacture for the human race

The greatest story that was ever told in the lights of history
Was the grand designs of other men
And they built those walls for you and me

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men
Don't start thinking with your heart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men

When the work is done, the work is done
We'll bebionic and beyond the circuits of our minds
We'll get nothing done under electric sun
Leave the weight of labor far behind

We're the greatest story that was ever told
But we don't know where we're from
And the walls became but a memory
Of the days when all the work begun

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men

Rejoice the day, the day the work is done
Rejoice the day, the day the work is done

Everybody's counting hours
Everybody's counting hours

Til the day the work is done
Til the day the work is done

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
'Cause idle hands make idle men

Rejoice the day, the day the work is done

Everybody's counting hours
Everybody's counting hoursLet all that's simple pass you by
Let all that lives be free to die
We're all, we're all key to life
Face all that rage and history
It makes no sense to you and me
We're all, we're all free to fight
I broke all my vows, my common sense
Says find vocation somewhere else

This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
Tonight

Lay all that's sinful down to rest
May all our judgments be confessed
We're all, we're all guilty now
Drink for the crowd not for yourself
Til someone hears your cry for help
Let's all, let's all take a bow
I spent all my mind on making sense
It made no difference in the end
This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
Tonight

I close my eyes and I am somebody else
Tonight I close my eyes and I don't need any help
Every moment of laughter
Every moment I fear
Every moment that you're not here

This should've been so beautiful, so beautiful, be so beautiful
This should have been so beautiful, been so beautiful

This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
TonightDon't stay where you are not loved
Those people obscure the view
But if I've done my job
They won't wanna mess with you

Finding some romances
A place where you exist
Live with your mother' smile
But see you through daddy's eyes

You might lose your dignity
But it's not what it used to be

And don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like kings and queens
I'll be the first, the last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to me

Just listen to your heart
Not the voices in your head
Forget how it'd made you feel
But don't forget what was said

Tears are words than we can touch
When words only say so much
Look out? what you've got
Then you'll always have enough

You might lose your dignity
But look what its done for me

And don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like kings and queens
I'll be the first, the last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to me

And don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like kings and queens
I'll be the first, the last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to meAlien Alien Alien Alien Alien Alien Alien Alien

What a wonderful world this is
It makes me want to kiss
What a beautiful kiss this is
What a beautiful kiss of life
Just before I die
I've been spending time
I've been losing time

Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet
All those minutes get lost in time
One step forward two steps behind
So before I think myself too deep
What a wonderful world this is
What a wonderful world this is
What a delicate tale of bliss
That I don't want to miss
In this moment where we all exist
On the precipice of the abyss
It always was, how it is
Spending time, wasting time
I've been spending time, I've been wasting time

Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet
All those minutes get lost in time
One step forward two steps behind
So before I think myself too deep
What a wonderful world this is

No time
Am I losing my mind
No time
Am I losing my mind
There's no time for us, no time for us until we're out of time (we're
Running out of time)
There's no time for us, no time
What a wonderful world this is
There's no time for us, no time (we're running out of time)
(Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keepOh I can see the future
Coming to you
Crying with the sadness in your eyes
And I can find a faith in years I've wasted
Being around enough to feel alive
And when the world is broken, hurt and colder
No one ever knows the reason why
For the ones we may become
For the balance we have won
For the day we wish the sun
Gonna play it loud tonight

When you dream of a dream
And you live in the world
Every hope is a hope
For the best don't want you resting my bones
And you're calling me now
I will see you all the time
Should be out there living the life
And not just watching you

Take me back
Before we all explode
Before we turn to stone
Before the light is gone
Take me back
To where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before the day goes off

Tonight we gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight, we'll remember
We'll remember these days

What a day to believe
To believe in the night
Want a date to belong, to a face in the crowd to the beat of your heart
And the moment begin
And you're working it out
And you're holding us all
In your hands, don't want you waiting for

Take me back
Before we lose control
Before the tables turn
Before we break it off
Take me back
To where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before they take us off

Tonight we gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight, we'll remember
We'll remember these days

Total devastation
In the darkness you must enter the code
And crack the combination all on your own

Pick yourself up and search for the light
Hungry for a new start
It's your chance now to stand up and fight
Take the next step now a day at a time

Waiting for a restart
Leaving all that once what was holding you back
Want you to see the sun rise as fast as you can

Pick it up, turn it round (Ooh)
Want you to see the sun rise as fast as you can

Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life?
Do you really love life?
Do you really love life? 
Do you really love life?

Hard up, cut me up
Good day, out of luck
My bones set in stone
Dear Lord, take me home
Crowd surf, out of bounds
Drink till we're falling down
Made up that you came
Big dreams till the end
Some say we came out of the sea 
Long time ago it's true
I come out of the ocean
To make my peace with you
I'm only fighting for you girl
I'm only fighting for the world
Before they bring me down
Out of Heaven to the ground 

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life?
Do you really love life?

Forward, sweep me up
High tide, good enough
Sad face, when we're low
Always, step to the right
Amen, ready made
Bad dreams, out again
Fireworks, good to know
Today's the start of the weekend

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life? 

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life?

What a way, what a way
What a way to go
Maybe something
Maybe nothing
But it's all I know
What a way, what a way
What a way to go 
Giving all my love 

What a way, what a way
What a way to go
Maybe something
Maybe nothing
But it's all I know
What a way, what a way
What a way to go 
Giving all my love

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life?

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - Did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - Do you really love life?Life slow down
You've gone too fast
And words begin to mean a little less

Bones stay strong
Cause the road ahead is long
And every voice will miss us when we're gone

Take a portrait, 25 let me hear you singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba [x2]

You're free to come alive
You're free to come tonightI used to be broken
Stuck in a cage
I used to be low down
I couldn't be saved
Now I feel like a lion
That cannot be tamed
'Cause you brought me back to life, to life again

I was fearless but so easily
I let life fade away the colour of my dreams
Now you're with me, I know I can be
Higher, higher than higher

(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be on the ground
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be out of my mind
Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be lost in the fire
If you weren't, you weren't here
Couldn't open up my eyes
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)

The sky is a long way
When covered in rain
You gave me my vision
You gave me my faith
And now I'm a fighter
I found the flame
You set me alight, alight again

I was fearless but so easily
I let life fade away the colour of my dreams
Now you're with me, I know I can be
Higher, higher than higher

(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be on the ground

Couldn't open up my eyes
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)

And it's all for me

Yeah when it's all for me
I can get away to a better place
Hey I'm looking down
Yeah I'm looking down
I can see you now
Are you coming out

There's a voice in my head
And it's talking again
Out of time, out of space
It's a feeling a meaning that I can taste

I don't know what people see but I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
I don't know why people give but I'll take it (I'll take it), I'll take it (I'll take it)

I don't know what people see but I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
I don't know why people give but I'll take it (I'll take it), I'll take it (I'll take it)

Always leave them wanting more

All the pressure on your heart
Heavy load inside your head

And a little bit of conversation
With a head full of hope
And a bit of your self belief
Is it asking too much to
Rely on your imagination
Am I asking too much
To remain in your company
Stop everything

We can stay here if you hold still
We can stay here for life if you say you will
We'll be caught in a moment of time
If we all freeze...
Don't even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won't leave
Freeze

With the flicker of a promise
And in view of our situation
I think you should know
That I never wanted this to change
And you're free to say whatever you want to
But whatever you want, whatever you want
Don't change
Please don't change

We can stay here if you hold still
We can stay here for life if you say you will
We'll be caught in a moment of time
If we all freeze...
Don't even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won't leave

The words, the words we never say
Don't make a sound till it's too late
Just freeze so we don't have to start again
Before we make the same mistakes
Before we throw it all away
The words, the words we never say
Don't make a sound till it's too late
Just freeze so we don't have to start again
Before we make the same mistakes
Before we throw it all away

Don't even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won't leave

Didn't stop, all this space
It makes me want to see your face
Such a beautiful place
When I met you last I was at a loss
Life goes on
Breakin' hard into the ground
It was you that I found

I can run if you are callin'
I can fly if you are fallin'
I can break through every wall they build for me
I can see the sun is risin'
I can see your eyes are smilin'
I will hold onto the things that I believe
Believe

Shut my eyes I feel alive
Hold me back
In our hearts, we'll wear the scars
Of the wilderness years
Give me one more night at last
Filled with joy
When your guard is down
And you're hand in hand
Will you understand how lucky we are
It's been a very long day

I can run if you are callin'
I can fly if you are fallin'
I can break through every wall they build for me
I can see the sun is risin'
I can see your eyes are smilin'

If you heard her voice calling your name you'd never be the same
Nothing was new and nowhere was safe and sound
And then she arrived, oh just in time to save this heart of mine
Oh, I'd waited all my life

All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My head's in the clouds I'm no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing

Maybe she knows, and maybe she'll soon be mine
In a perfect world, you know that this girl would be right here tonight
Weighing heavy on my mind

All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My head's in the clouds I'm no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing

Maybe my heart and my head are colliding
Or maybe it's more than I dare to believe
Don't ever let me forget what I'm feeling
Or wake up to find that it's all just a dream

All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My head's in the clouds that I'm no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazingGive me your hurt if you need someone to blame
Give me your call if you need someone to save

When I need somewhere to cry
Yeah, the feeling is sensational
And you gotta understand
How the music makes me feel wonderland

All your dreams are made
All your dreams are made
In Wonderland
In Wonderland

(You wanna see what you came here for?)

Music makes me feel good

Everybody's feeling wonderlandWe're all giants, I can't believe it
We were giants all along
On the surface and all around us
We are giants, we are strong

I see you standing, see you dancing
On the pavement, in the park
We are giants, can you feel it
So much bigger than we thought

I think I might be heading out of body
I've gotta love, you've gotta love somebody

When I look in your eyes
I'm bigger than the night sky
As high as the sun, high as a storm
We are giants, we are giants
We are giants

There are giants across the water
There are giants heading home
In the middle of the madness
There are giants being born

I feel us breaking out of empty glory
I've gotta love, you've gotta love somebody like you

When I look in your eyes
I'm bigger than the night sky
As high as the sun, high as a storm
We are giants, we are giants
When I look in your eyes
I'm bigger than the night sky
As high as the sun, high as a storm
We are giants, we are giants

We are giants in our hearts
We are giants, every one of us
We are giants in our hearts
We are giants, we are giants

When I look in your eyes
I'm bigger than the night sky
As high as the sun, high as a storm
We are giants, we are giants
We are giants
We are giants
As high as the sun, high as a storm
We are giants, we are giants
We are giantsFall, fall, fall
Oh oh oh 
Woke up from a bad dream
I was feeling half-naked, running down the high street
Shouting your name, I was begging you not to go
Yesterday's news is yesterday's news
Yesterday's blues is just a shade of colour
Call me naive but we're building for tomorrow
So we can
So we can finish off what we started
 
Wake up, it's a brand new day
Everybody's gotta sing this storm away
So come along now and lead the way
Oh make way through the waterfalls
'Cause together we will soon get it past it all
No one ever needs to fall
No one ever needs to fall
Fall, fall, fall
No one ever needs to fall

All into position
One final frontier 'til we make it to the station
Heading up to Zion, listening to the radio
Too much to regret, yeah
Still, I'm a monome yeah, not a multi-tasker
Talking revolution, talking revolution
I talk about you all the time

Wake up, it's a brand new day
Everybody's gotta sing this storm away
So come along now, lead the way
(So come along now, lead the way)
Make way through the waterfalls
'Cause together we will soon get it past it all
No one ever needs to fall
No one ever needs to fall, fall

We can lose it all, can lose it all tonight (fall)
We can make it out, can make it out alive (fall)
If we can give it all, can give it all the time (fall)
We can finish off what we started

Wake up, it's a brand new day

I need to shake away the fuzz
Too much attention can destroy you
Too much affection not enough
You got me hooked, I'm fascinated
My body's crawling on all fours
Before I lose myself to Mother Nature
Before I get myself some more

Because the world is changing (our world is changing)
Because you turn me on

I'm gonna count my lucky stars
I love you just the way you are
I'm gonna count my lucky stars
I love you just the way you are

No need to ask me for direction
Hold back the side of our control
I'll take your word as confirmation
All of the sky into my soul
While they are searching for perfection
I'm trying not to understand
You may have lost me in your conversation
You may have found me in the end

Because the world is changing (our world is changing)
Because you turn me on

I'm gonna count my lucky stars
I love you just the way you are
I'm gonna count my lucky stars
I love you just the way you are

Before the night has faded
Stay with me 'til Sunday morning
Won't you stay 'til Sunday morning?

I'm gonna count my lucky stars
I love you just the way you are

I love you just the way you areIf life was simple
Every day like Sunday afternoon
There'd be no reason
To wake up, fight back, be a better you

Come dance by the fire
'Til you're feeling higher than the State of Empire
Let that New York feeling kill your pain into your ears
Let the rhythm dry your tears
As the world stops

And the band plays
Walking to the light all of a sudden
And the band plays
Always making something out of nothing
Turn your heartache into loving
And the band plays

Beware the straight roads
Or they'll catch you sleeping at the wheel, yeah yeah yeah
The warning sirens are more than sounds
There's something you can feel

Come let down your hair Let your despair be shared
You can dance in your bed let that downtown feeling
Kill your pain and all your fears Let the rhythm dry your tears
As the work stops

We're always making something out of nothing
Turn your heartache into loving

Screaming at the trombones oh 
Walking to the light all of a sudden
And the band plays
You know we're always making something out of nothing
Turn your heartache into loving

Somebody shouting 'don't jump, don't hit the ground'
Standing here closer to the moon, get my halo ready
Don't worry, I'll be there soon

Somewhere up ahead I hear it coming
Like a bullet to the brain
Somewhere in the crowd I feel the loving
Will we ever be the same?

I'm a superstar
I'm a superstar
I'm a superstar
It's gonna be a long way down

Lying on train track, ooh, there's a train coming
Faster than a hurricane
Don't mind me, look away, I'm the stranger
No one knew that I could save the day

Put me on a list, my name and number
Tell them that I've come so far
Gonna be as loud as rain and thunder
And now I'm ready for the stars

Face the lonely fear
Imagine that the tightrope was here
There's angels in the silence
The taste of your own tears
Is cold

Everybody needs a little hope, hope, hope
(Hope, hope, hope)

Bathe in every blessing
Burn your brightest flame
Love's the only bible we claim

I spent my time here just holding on
Afraid to let go, the weight's swinging in my soul
No time for shaking this heavy load
Before I take myself down, sinking like a stone

Gotta get myself together
Gotta wash my body clean
If I try to live forever
Gonna be the death of me
'Cause a ghost is in the water
And it's haunted by the future
Gotta leave himself to nature
Gotta take me to the sea

Let me be a river, won't you carry me?
I can hear you calling me (you calling me)
Gotta trust that river gonna lead me somewhere
Be a river, won't you carry me?
I can hear you calling me (you calling me)
Gotta trust that river gonna lead me somewhere

Be a river, won't you carry me?
I can hear you calling me

I'm going down with the waterfall
Heading to places they haven't made a record for
Keep on the good side of every low
Nowhere to hide, no horizon, nowhere to go

Sometimes I feel you with me
Sometimes I go alone
Sometimes you give your blessing
Sometimes I feel the love
That river gonna take me there, that river gonna take me there
That river gonna take me there, yeah, I know that river gonna take me there

That river gonna take me there, that river gonna take me there
That river gonna take me there, yeah, I know that river gonna take me there

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Left on Earth
Known by all as man of words
If was the last poet heard by all
They would watch as the silence roars

Got my hands up, oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta stand up, oh, oh, oh, oh

But for you I can't find words
But for you I can't find words

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

With a broken feather
And unused ink
Going crazy trying to translate what I think
When we see something so beautiful
A monastery of light and soul
Stand taller than the high cathedral walls

Got my hands up, oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta stand up, oh, oh, oh, oh

But for you I can't find words
But for you I can't find words
But for you I can't find words
But for you there are no words

Last poet, last man in this century
To lay down with no sympathy
To put words where they shouldn't be
The last poet, last man in this century
To lay down with no sympathy
To put words where they shouldn't be
Oh, they shouldn't be
They shouldn't be there
They shouldn't be thereI can still believe the sky
Isn't rolling through the night
While I sleep fast like a stone
And the ground we're standing on
Is what we fixed ourselves upon
Go on, you can't change what you know

There were chances left untaken
Lost diversions in the road
And far-off islands in the sea
A house of flowers
A chapter and a verse
A sheet of white where we all shared our dreams

And we turn every revolution
Every revolution, bringing us symphonies
Take a breath and count our lucky days
Hold me here with every revolution
Pulling together now
There's a brand new life in my soul, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Now there's water in the well
And the ring has found a bell
To tell the world we're not alone
From the silent sky a plane arrives
I feel like I've been waiting all my life
To welcome you back home

There's a wave coming in to break
The tension as we crash upon the beach
Up ahead the blanket full of stars
A pencil sketch to lie down underneath

And we turn every revolution
Every revolution bringing us symphonies
Take a breath and count our lucky days
Hold me here with every revolution
Pulling together now
There's a brand new life in my soul, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

And we turn every revolution
Every revolution bringing us symphonies
Take a breath and count our lucky days
Hold me here with every revolution
Pulling together now
There's a brand new life in my soul, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-ohThe world is smiling
It's a little brighter
There's less politics
A little more laughter
Wars become silent
Everything's different
Nothing is hurting
And it's all working
Look at the courage
That's emanating
Saving the hearts
That were breaking
Oh yeah, it's coming
To those who are waiting
You know that it's true

It's all for you
The sun and the clouds and the blue
It's all for you
It's coming in bloom for you (for you)

Birds are singing
Quiet celebration
Right through the universe
And all across the nation
Tired hearts hoping
Building what was broken
A strength in the community
A reason to believe
Look at the message
It's high and low
If you don't listen, you'll never know
Let go of your chains
Oh, come out of your cage
The road it's all leading to

It's all for you
The sun and the clouds and the blue
It's all for you
It's coming in bloom for you

Everyone around you, everyone that's missing
'Til the light can find you
No one's gonna know
Everyone around you, everyone that needs you
No, don't leave us waiting
Everyone should know

Everyone around you, everyone that's missing
'Til the light can find you
No one's gonna know

No, don't leave us waiting
Everyone should know

It's all for you
It's waiting here for you
It's all for you (all for you)
It's all for you (all for you)
It's all for you
It's waiting here for you
High in the clouds above, you know, you know, you know
It's here for you
Waiting here for youI've disappointed you, I know
But I've learned that wholeheartedly
I want you back
And I'm sad, sad that I hurt you so wrong
Now I'm here taking so seriously my monogamy

Oh, so don't, don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't, don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me

If I could turn back time, I would
Every word say it so differently if I could
But here in the present tense for us
Let me show you what I would do for your love
I'll be a priest or a saint
Be a lion you can tame
Give you wings to be free
Be the balance you need
I'll be a martyr or a hero
Be the answer when you don't know
I can change what you see
Can be better so please, please, please

Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me

Hope you can hear my voice right here
Why does it feel that you're so far away but so near
We've escaped from the loudest voice so now
We can conquer any mountain without falling down
I'll be a priest (priest) or a saint (or a saint)
Be the lion you can tame
Give you wings to be free
Be the balance you need
I'll be a martyr (martyr) or a hero (or a hero)
Be the answer when you don't know

Can be better so please, please, please

Don't give up on me
Don't, don't give up on meEverybody's writing on the wall
Taking all day long to read it all
Staring in the face of what's to come
Coming down I've saved a space for you

Up, up
Thought you wanted to be up
Thought you wanted to be loved
Don't you want to be loved?

Who could live without the harmony
The hundred million years of history
It's only coming down to you and me
Give me time and I'll make it up to you

Up, up
Thought you wanted to be up
Thought you wanted to be loved
Don't you want to be loved?

Reaching up to turn the clock around
It's like a ladder to my heart
A feeling that I got when I was young
Like the days, the days
Were folding up into my pocket
And honestly I wouldn't change a single thing about the time we had

Up, up
Thought you wanted to be up
Thought you wanted to be loved
Don't you want to be loved?
Don't you want to be

Up, up
Thought you wanted to be up
Thought you wanted to be loved
Don't you want to be loved?Looks like the sun has gone
Looks like the rain is here
Maybe we tried too hard
And what we had has disappeared
We gave it the same reaction
In between the heat and passion
But back in these distant plains
I only want to see your face

Come on, love
Come on, love
Just show your face
'Cause we're giving up
Come on, love
Come on, love
Release yourself
'Cause we've given enough

Come on, love
Come on, love
Just show your face
'Cause we're giving up
Come on, love
Come on, love
Release yourself
'Cause we've given enough

What are we asking
Asking to start again
This other world we're trapped in
Feels like it's coming to an end
Emergency lights are flashing
Against every wall we're crashing
Alone in these distant plains
I just want to see your face

Come on, love
Come on, love
Just show your face
'Cause we're giving up
Come on, love
Come on, love
Release yourself
'Cause we've given enough
We give our hearts, give our souls
Until some time we can all be home
So come on, love
Come on, love
Bring us back together now

So come on, love
Try and lift us higher
Our last hope, you know what to do
Come on, love
Even if you're tired
I'll stand by yours
Come on, love (woah)
Don't you, don't you forget about me
Don't you, don't you forget about us

Forget about me, forget about us (Don't you, don't you)

Come on
Say you'll be back some dayI've been drowning in the river
Tried to soothe my soul
Take me under, take me deeper
Than I choose to go
I can't see it any clearer
I said long ago
But down here underneath the surface
You're my only hope

If you remember me everyone else can forget
Everyone else can forget
Tell them I have nothing, nothing

'Cause I'd rather go blind
Than watch you walk out of my life
Turn my face up to the sky
You know we all, we all, we all, we all cry
Heart on the line for the love we left behind
I can't let you go this time
And oh I know, I know, I know you hear me
Cry, cry, cry
I know, I know, I know you hear me

I've been waiting for the storm
To surrender my soul
Bathe me in your holy water and lay me down

If you remember me everyone else can forget
Everyone else can forget
Tell them I have nothing, nothing

'Cause I'd rather go blind
Than watch you walk out of my life
Turn my face up to the sky
You know we all, we all, we all, we all cry
Heart on the line for the love we left behind
I can't let you go this time
And oh I know, I know, I know you hear me
Cry, cry, cry
I know, I know, I know you hear me
Cry, cry, cry
I know, I know, I know you hear me

Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender, surrender
'Cause I surrender

I'd rather go blind
Than watch you walk out of my life
Turn my face up to the sky
You know we all, we all, we all, we all cry
Heart on the line for the love we left behind
I can't let you go this time
And oh I know, I know, I know you hear me
Cry, cry, cry
I know, I know, I know you hear me
Cry, cry, cry
I know, I know, I know you hear me cryAnd we've come so far
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young
And we hope for more

Today this could be
The greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends
Before we run out of time

Stay close to me
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be
The greatest night of our lives
Let's make a new start
The future is ours to find

Can you see it?
Can you see it in my eyes?
Can you feel it now?
Can you hold it in your arms tonight?
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on (tonight)
Hold on, hold on

Oh, stay close to me (hold on)

Stay close to me (and the world comes alive)
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me (hold on)
Oh

You know, every time we went to a club there was more people coming in
And we got quite a good following, you know
So we started writing magazine people
And they could see the sort of reaction we were getting
And I think it just grew from that, you know
It was a natural courseOh I can see the future
Coming to you
Crying with the sadness in your eyes
And I can find a faith in years I've wasted
Being around enough to feel alive
And when the world is broken, hurt and colder
No one ever knows the reason why
For the ones we may become
For the balance we have won
For the day we wish the sun
Gonna play it loud tonight

When you dream of a dream
And you live in the world
Every hope is a hope
For the best don't want you resting my bones
And you're calling me now
I will see you all the time
Should be out there living the life
And not just watching you

Take me back
Before we all explode
Before we turn to stone
Before the light is gone
Take me back
To where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before the day goes off

Tonight we gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight, we'll remember
We'll remember these days

What a day to believe
To believe in the night
Want a date to belong, to a face in the crowd to the beat of your heart
And the moment begin
And you're working it out
And you're holding us all
In your hands, don't want you waiting for

Take me back
Before we lose control
Before the tables turn
Before we break it off
Take me back
To where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before they take us off

Oh I can see the future
Coming to you
Crying with the sadness in your eyes
And I can find a faith in years I've wasted
Being around enough to feel alive
And when the world is broken, hurt and colder
No one ever knows the reason why
For the ones we may become
For the balance we have won
For the day we wish the sun
Gonna play it loud tonight

Tonight we gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight, we'll remember
We'll remember these days

Tonight, tonight, we gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight, we'll remember

What do you hear 
A million words just trying to make 
The love song of the year 
Close your eyes but don't forget 
What you have heard 
A man who's trying to say three words 
The words that make me scared 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
And here I am 
Here I am
A million love songs later
Here I am

Looking to the future now 
This is what I see 
A million chances pass me by 
A million chances to hold you 
Take me back, take me back 
To where I used to be 
To hide away from all my truth 
Through the light I see 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
Here I am
Just for you girl
A million love songs later
Here I am
I feel for you, babe
Feel for you baby
A million love songs later
Here I, here I amSure, so sure
Sure, so sure
Feel it, move it, feel it, move back
Need you so much, yeah, yeah
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

Sitting here runnin' to my lover (lover)
Last time we met, I wasn't to sure (not so sure)
Now I'm hoping, maybe dreaming, for a life as one
When she reads this I'm hoping she'll call (call me baby)
I need more much, more than before
I need positive reactions, whenever I'm down

'Cause I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking on my door
Sure, so sure, so baby come on inside
Need you so much, more and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure, that it's sweet love I found

It's not a game, so don't play hard to get
Tired of running after you
There's no connections holding us down (down)
Isn't it a shame (shame), that it never happened (isn't it a shame), oh yeah
Though still here we are the second time round
It's gonna be social, compatible, sexual, irresistible
It's gotta be right for life

Now I'm sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking at my door

So honey, why don't you beg me to stay
For love and talk the way we used to talk
To we both know what we've lost
Never said the words we did before
Till it was over
Love ain't here anymore
No, no, love ain't here anymore
It's gone away to a town called yesterday
Love ain't here anymore
Listen, oh, listen
I don't want to let go
So baby, we can change the way we feel
For love dumping up the way we did before
Now it's the right time and I'm sure
Never said the words you did before
When it was over
Love ain't here anymore
No, no love ain't here anymore
It's gone away to that town called yesterday
Love don't live here anymore
And when I find a place for me to keep my sweety love
Then I will live in there for ever more
And when I find someone to share
I'll never give up
I will hold on, believe that
This love means too more
Love ain't here anymore
Love ain't here anymore
Love ain't here anymore
Love ain't here anymore...When the tears fall away
And there's no conversation
There's nothing left to break
That's not already broken
You're staring into space
And every inch of silence
Been standing here for days, and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

In the sudden light of day
The weight of expectation
Hurt begins to fade
As you find a new direction
Been talking here for days and days and days

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Doesn't matter any more

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

All of the miles of words we've spoken
All of the lines that got away
Didn't we take the time to say them all?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we heard enough?

Said it all
Nothing to say at all
Nothing to say that matters
Haven't we said it all?Tudutudu

I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch my hand in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep you warm in your love then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love, how deep is your love?
I really need to learn 'cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
And know you're the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall (When I fall)

And you may not think that I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love, how deep is your love? (Oh)
I really need to learn 'cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

You're the light
You're my life

(When I fall) And you may not think that I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do

Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Unaware but underlined

It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me

ShineWe've come so far
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young
And we hope for more

We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
We've had success
We've had good times
But remember this

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there
With danger on my mind
I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realised what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I looked so high I don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of I can't explain this feeling now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I make
And the fact of reality

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far 
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young 
And we hope for more
But remember this
We're not invincible
We're not invincible, no (we're not invincible)
We're only people (ooh)
We're only people (we're not invincible)
Hey we're not invincible (we're not invincible)
We're not invincible
So again I'll tell you

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never (ooh, hoo, hoo) (never! Never! Never!)
Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing ooh baby
Never, no never
Never forget, oh, no
Someday
Louder, louder, louder, louder loud
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah louder, louder, loud now
Someday, come on, come on
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody

Never forget where you're coming from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for moreHelp me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (come on, yeah), your love is my only desire (I need your love)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need, I need your love

Yeah, you got to be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah)
Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah
Strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side (on the other side)
And I got hope (hope) in my soul, I'll keep walkin' baby
Keep on walkin' baby

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire (only desire)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight me fire (relight my fire) relight my fire baby
Relight my fire (I need your love, yeah yeah)

Relight my fire (yeah yeah), your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your loveI come to your door to see you again,
But where you once stood was an old man instead
I asked where you'd be, he said she's moved, on you see
All I have is a number you'd better ask her not me
So I picked up the phone and dialed your number
Not sure to put it down or speak
Then a voice I once knew answered in a sweet voice
She said hello then paused before I began to speak

Babe I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

You held your voice well, there were tears I could tell
But where were you now, was you gonna tell me in time?
Just give me a town and I'll be straight down
I've got so much to tell you about where I have been
As I walk down your road, can't wait to be near you
I can't keep the feeling in inside (I, I, I can't keep it inside)
As I stand at your door you answered in a sweet voice
You said hello then pause before I begin to speak

Babe (Babe), I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), I'm back again (I'm back again)
I tell you I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been?

As I looked away, I saw a face behind you
A little boy stood at your door
And as I looked again I saw his face was shining
He had my eyes (My eyes), he had my smile (my smile)

Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
I'm back again (Babe)
Where have you been? (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), please take me back (I'm back again)
Take me back (Babe)
Back here again
Babe, I'm back again (I'm here again),
Can't you see that I'm back again (Babe)
I'm here for you (Where have you been)
Babe (Babe), just me and you (I'm back again)
You and me (Babe)
OohWhen the time comes near
For me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for
Hiding from a world I need to hear now
Don't think I'll hear it again
But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side
But the morning always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes

Chorus:]
All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day
All I do each night is think
Of all the times i closed the door to keep my love within

If you can't forgive the past
I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights so I regret it
I never showed you my love

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side
But the morning always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes

[Chorus:]

Surely we must be in sight
Of the dream we long to live
If you stop and close your eyes
You'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

[Chorus:]

Come on
Time is running out
You and me
Harmony
You and me...You light the skies, up above me
A star, so bright, you blind me, yeah
Don't close your eyes
Don't fade away, don't fade away, oh

Yeah, you and me, we can ride on a star
If you stay with me, girl
We can rule the world
Yeah, you and me, we can light up the sky
If you stay by my side
We can rule the world

If walls break down, I will comfort you
If angels cry, oh I'll be there for you
You've saved my soul
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now, oh

Yeah, you and me, we can ride on a star
If you stay with me, girl
We can rule the world
Yeah, you and me, we can light up the sky
If you stay by my side
We can rule the world

Oh, all the stars are coming out tonight

I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out

All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, so come on, get it on

Stop (stop)
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile

Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all

So come on, oh come on, get it on
