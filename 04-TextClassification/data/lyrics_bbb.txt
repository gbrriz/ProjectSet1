Oh girl, I'm sorry of what I put you through 
Girl I'd do anything for one more chance
'Cause I want you back again 

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I see 

You and I we shared enough together 
Each other was all we'd ever need 
I thought that you would stay with me forever 
But I took for granted the love you gave to me 
But I'll keep on trying, till the end 
Baby I need you back with me

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I see 

And girl I'm going out of my mind 
I miss ya so much, I don't know what to do 
Please say its just a matter of time, 
Until I feel your touch, 
Until you let me come back to you 

I think about you girl every time at night 
I'm in love, and it feels so right 
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain 
I was just caught up in the lying game 
But now those days are over, I've changed my ways 
Now I'm counting the minutes, I'm counting the days 
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start 
To find a new way to get back into your heart 

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I seeBaby, can I talk to you?
I know something's wrong
Things just ain't the same
But deep down inside
I know you still care
So tell me what to do
To get things back
The way they used to be

If your words had meaning
If you really cared about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart
If you were my lover
A constant friend to me
Tell me why
Would you turn away from my love

Everybody

Backstreet's back alright

Everybody
Rock your body
Everybody
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back alrightAlthough loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't know)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (yeah)
As long as you love me
As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did (yeah)
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love meI don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know
But if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine!

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

To you, hey girl
Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
I Love You

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you
My love is all I have to give

My love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you

I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you[Chorus]
Oh baby I'm missing you 
We used the love so strong 
Tell me where do we go 
Oh baby I'm missing you 
They said I'd learn to forget but it sure ain't happen yet 

Been checkin' out the places where we used to go 
Been lookin' for your face inside the crowd 
I've been talkin' to the people what we used to know 
Nobody wants to say where you hang out

And when I call your phone 
Seems like you're never home 
And you don't return my call 
It tears me apart 
This is breakin' up my heart 

[Chorus]

I still have your pictures hung around my room 
That's the only thing that is left of you with me 
Girl what can I do to make you come back soon
And make it just the way it used to be

Oh, this is someone new 
Can never go on without you 
Girl I don't want to think about it 
I can't sleep at night 
No this can't be right 
Come back into my life 
(Come back baby come back) 

[Chorus]

I know there's a chance for you and I 
And I believe there's no way our love could die 
So no matter how long it takes I'll wait for you 
And what ever it takes I'll be there for you 
I'll be there, I'll be there 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]Hey, yeah
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
That's the way I like it
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)

Somebody told me that you're not my kind
So have I lost my mind? (That's the way I like it)
You keep on doing all the things I like
You've got me hypnotized
But that's the way I like it

Girl you make me wanna move
It's the price I got to pay
For all the things you do
But I like it
You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

Oh, mystery lady, you've got somethin' I like
Tell me you're here to stay (ooh yeah)
You're dangerous, oh baby
Could you do me right?
Will you come out to play?
'Cause that's the way I like it

Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now

You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
Hey, yeah!

That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it

(That's the way that, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)
(That's the way)Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh, what a life
Once we were dreamers just dreamers we were
Oh, you and I
Now I see you're just somebody who wastes all my time and money
What a lie, you and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

Once I could handle the truth
When the truth was you and I
But time after time all the
Promises turned out to be all lies
Now I see I'm just somebody who wasted my time and money
What a lie (what a lie, what a lie, oh)
You and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

You said "I'll take you back"
But I closed the door 'cause I don't want
10,000 more
Oh

10,000 promises yeah (oh)
10,000 promises you gave to me

Repeat chorus
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me (That you gave to me)
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me
Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh you and I
What a lieIf I could right the wrongs that made you cry 
I make a promise not to say good-night
"Cause I'm holding on 
With a love so strong
And I can't take a day without you by my side

Girl if i could change
If I could change your mind
Baby you could  help me wipe these tears from my eyes

[Chorus]
Girl don't stop
The sun from shining down on me 
'Cause  I can't face another day without your smile
And if you take away the love and arms that surround me 
The I might break down and cry just like a child

Girl,I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me
So I'm pressin' on
I hope you understand
There's a broken heart that lies inside your hands

So if I could change 
And it won't hurt your pride
Baby you could help me stop these tears that I cry

[Chorus]

Like a child 
Just like a child
With the spirits running free 
She showed my why
Oh, she did

Like a child(oh baby)
Just like a child
Think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
Like a child

[Chorus]do, da da da da
do, da da da da
do, da da da da

The candle plays the hourglass
Days go and all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
Every smile even all the reasons why
You say I pushed you out of my life

Chorus
Baby you set me (ha-ha-ahhh)
Baby you set me (do da da da da)
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you set me 
Set adrift on memory bliss

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with 
The biggest empty void 
I've ever had in life (ever had in life)
Bet you say that I don't care
Bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there 
when the mornin comes
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life)
Baby will you be there
When I open my eyes
After all the time I've spent 
Wishing you

Chorus

Sadness has overwhelmed me
my mind flies carelessly 
I Imagine that you're happy 
With your life right now
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things
That I could never have

Chorus to fade
The candle plays the hourglass
The days go and all I do is
Think of you and wonder where you are at night
Oh I remember everything
Every smile, and even all
The reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my life

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life (ever had in life) ohh
Bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there when the morning comes?
(Baby will you be there?)
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life, baby)
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes?
After all the time I've spent, wishing you

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind flies and carelessly
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now oh
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things that I can never have

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

So come on now
I know this much is true
I know this much is trueThere are people who say what you want to hear 
Even on a rainy day they'll tell you the sky is clear 
When you really, really love someone 
And I'm right when I say that you want them near 
And if you can't even tell 
Them things that they want to hear 

[Chorus]
Always forever, all the things she said 
Never say never, those simple lies that she fed 
I will never leave you 
All the love I thought she had 
But can you blame me, no, 
'Cause that's what she said 
That's what she said 
She told me we'd see forever 
That's what she said, she said, yeah 

And,
There are people who that say what they really mean 
She said she'd always be there 
She said she'd always care 
But just when you think that you can trust that someone ya love 
Tell me why do you know 
How stars can fall from above 

[Chorus]

'Cause you made promises that you couldn't keep 
But you're not hurting' yourself 
But you're only hurting me (you're only hurting me) 
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean 
Oh how can I make you see just-a what you did to me 

Oh, you said how much you really cared 
Just when I thought I was in love 
Girl, how could you dare 
If I were you I wouldn't lie not even-a once 
To the face of the one that I love so much 

[Chorus]

Oh that's what she saidIf you want it to be good girl

Even in my heart I see
You're not bein' true to me
Deep within my soul I feel

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
Quit playin' games with my heart

Quit playin' games with my heart
Before you tear us apart (my heart)

You're tearing us apart (my heart)
Quit playin' games with my heart

I live my life the way
To keep you comin' back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see?

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
You better quit playin' games with my heart

Oh boys will be boys

You've got something so that incredible in my eyes, 
My heart (my heart) is stars to bumpin' whenever you around 
My whole world upside down baby 
But I try to get closer and you always push me away 
You tell me its much too soon, but I just can't help it 
I've always got to make a play 

[Chorus]

All my senses, going around you all the time 
And I invences, I've never going hope 
Always gotta lose control

And I can't hold on any more, my body's callin' for ya 
So please don't hesitate 

[Chorus]

Go

I hear ya saying, that you think that we should wait 
And I can't hold on any more, my body's callin' for ya 
So please don't hesitate 
My body's callin' for ya 
So please don't hesitate 

[Chorus]This is for the lovers, 
Strictly for the lovers, year 
If you want some one you want to get close to, 
Then you get close to this 

Woo, just to be close to ya 

Yo, drop the verse 

Like a flower to a tree, that how close I want to be, 
To your heart (baby to your heart, heart) 
Like the stars to the night, and daytime is to light 
Will never part (will never part) 
I want you to be the only thing that I see 
'cause I believe it's our destiny 

[Chorus]
Just to be close, just to be close 
It's the only thing that I want to do 
Just to be close, just to be close 
Just to be close to ya (closer to ya) 
Just to be close 

So lonely is the night, without you to hold me tight 
(I want to hold ya closer) 
I need ya (baby hold me closer, closer) 
My life will mean nothing without the joy you bring 
To me, you know, you know, you know 
There were never (never be) no one else for me 
You were like the dream that become reality 

[Chorus] 

I want to give you all my love (all my love)

'Cause every word I say is straight from the heart 
I've been so wrong, I've never meant to hurt you 
Oh girl, I'm sorry of what I put you through 
Girl I'd do anything for one more chance
'Cause I want you back again 

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I see 

You and I we shared enough together 
Each other was all we'd ever need 
I thought that you would stay with me forever 
But I took for granted the love you gave to me 
But I'll keep on trying, till the end 
Baby I need you back with me 
I need you back

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I see 

And girl I'm going out of my mind 
I miss ya so much, I don't know what to do 
Please say its just a matter of time, 
Until I feel your touch, 
Until you let me come back to you 

I think about you girl every time at night 
I'm in love, and it feels so right 
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain 
I was just caught up in the lying game 
But now those days are over, I've changed my ways 
Now I'm counting the minutes, I'm counting the days 
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start 
To find a new way to get back into your heart 

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I seeBaby, can I talk to you?
I know something's wrong
Things just ain't the same
But deep down inside
I know you still care
So tell me what to do
To get things back
The way they used to be

If your words had meaning
If you really cared about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart
If you were my lover
A constant friend to me
Tell me why
Would you turn away from my love

I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't know)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (yeah)
As long as you love me
As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did (yeah)
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love meI don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know
But if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine!

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

To you, hey girl
Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
I Love You

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you
My love is all I have to give

My love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you

I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you[Chorus]
Oh baby I'm missing you 
We used the love so strong 
Tell me where do we go 
Oh baby I'm missing you 
They said I'd learn to forget but it sure ain't happen yet 

Been checkin' out the places where we used to go 
Been lookin' for your face inside the crowd 
I've been talkin' to the people what we used to know 
Nobody wants to say where you hang out

And when I call your phone 
Seems like you're never home 
And you don't return my call 
It tears me apart 
This is breakin' up my heart 

[Chorus]

I still have your pictures hung around my room 
That's the only thing that is left of you with me 
Girl what can I do to make you come back soon
And make it just the way it used to be

Oh, this is someone new 
Can never go on without you 
Girl I don't want to think about it 
I can't sleep at night 
No this can't be right 
Come back into my life 
(Come back baby come back) 

[Chorus]

I know there's a chance for you and I 
And I believe there's no way our love could die 
So no matter how long it takes I'll wait for you 
And what ever it takes I'll be there for you 
I'll be there, I'll be there 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]Hey, yeah
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
That's the way I like it
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)

Somebody told me that you're not my kind
So have I lost my mind? (That's the way I like it)
You keep on doing all the things I like
You've got me hypnotized
But that's the way I like it

Girl you make me wanna move
It's the price I got to pay
For all the things you do
But I like it
You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

Oh, mystery lady, you've got somethin' I like
Tell me you're here to stay (ooh yeah)
You're dangerous, oh baby
Could you do me right?
Will you come out to play?
'Cause that's the way I like it

Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)

Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on

You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
Hey, yeah!

That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it (everybody now)
That is the way I like it (everybody now)
That's the way that I like it (everybody come on)
That is the way I like it (everybody come on)
That's the way I like it

That's the way that I like it (everybody now)

That's the way I like it
That's the way I like it (everybody come on)
That is the way that I like it (everybody come on)
That is the way I like it

(That's the way that, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)
(That's the way)Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh, what a life
Once we were dreamers just dreamers we were
Oh, you and I
Now I see you're just somebody who wastes all my time and money
What a lie, you and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

Once I could handle the truth
When the truth was you and I
But time after time all the
Promises turned out to be all lies
Now I see I'm just somebody who wasted my time and money
What a lie (what a lie, what a lie, oh)
You and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

You said "I'll take you back"
But I closed the door 'cause I don't want
10,000 more
Oh

10,000 promises yeah (oh)
10,000 promises you gave to me

Repeat chorus
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me (That you gave to me)
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me
Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh you and I
What a lieIf I could right the wrongs that made you cry 
I make a promise not to say good-night
"Cause I'm holding on 
With a love so strong
And I can't take a day without you by my side

Girl if i could change
If I could change your mind
Baby you could  help me wipe these tears from my eyes

[Chorus]
Girl don't stop
The sun from shining down on me 
'Cause  I can't face another day without your smile
And if you take away the love and arms that surround me 
The I might break down and cry just like a child

Girl,I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me
So I'm pressin' on
I hope you understand
There's a broken heart that lies inside your hands

So if I could change 
And it won't hurt your pride
Baby you could help me stop these tears that I cry

[Chorus]

Like a child 
Just like a child
With the spirits running free 
She showed my why
Oh, she did

Like a child(oh baby)
Just like a child
Think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
Like a child

[Chorus]do, da da da da
do, da da da da
do, da da da da

The candle plays the hourglass
Days go and all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
Every smile even all the reasons why
You say I pushed you out of my life

Chorus
Baby you set me (ha-ha-ahhh)
Baby you set me (do da da da da)
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you set me 
Set adrift on memory bliss

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with 
The biggest empty void 
I've ever had in life (ever had in life)
Bet you say that I don't care
Bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there 
when the mornin comes
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life)
Baby will you be there
When I open my eyes
After all the time I've spent 
Wishing you

Chorus

Sadness has overwhelmed me
my mind flies carelessly 
I Imagine that you're happy 
With your life right now
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things
That I could never have

Chorus to fade
The candle plays the hourglass
The days go and all I do is
Think of you and wonder where you are at night
Oh I remember everything
Every smile, and even all
The reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my life

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life (ever had in life) ohh
Bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there when the morning comes?
(Baby will you be there?)
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life, baby)
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes?
After all the time I've spent, wishing you

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind flies and carelessly
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now oh
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things that I can never have

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

So come on now
I know this much is true
I know this much is trueThere are people who say what you want to hear 
Even on a rainy day they'll tell you the sky is clear 
When you really, really love someone 
And I'm right when I say that you want them near 
And if you can't even tell 
Them things that they want to hear 

[Chorus]
Always forever, all the things she said 
Never say never, those simple lies that she fed 
I will never leave you 
All the love I thought she had 
But can you blame me, no, 
'Cause that's what she said 
That's what she said 
She told me we'd see forever 
That's what she said, she said, yeah 

And,
There are people who that say what they really mean 
She said she'd always be there 
She said she'd always care 
But just when you think that you can trust that someone ya love 
Tell me why do you know 
How stars can fall from above 

[Chorus]

'Cause you made promises that you couldn't keep 
But you're not hurting' yourself 
But you're only hurting me (you're only hurting me) 
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean 
Oh how can I make you see just-a what you did to me 

Oh, you said how much you really cared 
Just when I thought I was in love 
Girl, how could you dare 
If I were you I wouldn't lie not even-a once 
To the face of the one that I love so much 

[Chorus]

Oh that's what she saidIf you want it to be good girl
Get yourself a bad boy

Everything's gone  all went wrong
I wish you were here

You know I'd go
out of my mind
If you ever left
my heart behind
So I'm begging you please
Bring your sweet love back to me

If I don't have you

If I don't have youI may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

All of your time spent keeps us alive

All you people can't you see, can't you see

Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Yeah, every time we're down
Yeah, you can make it right
Yeah, and that's what makes you larger than life

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger
That makes you larger
That makes you larger than lifeYeah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way

Am I, your fire?
Your one, desire

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way

Now I can see that we've fallen apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

You are my fire
The one desire
You are (you are, you are, you are)

I want it that way

'Cause I want it that wayShow me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze upon me
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be
You're asking me
To feel the things you never show

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are (where you are)
There's something missing in my heart

Show me the meaning of being lonely (being lonely)

(Hey yeah)

You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture
On the Backstreet's Back, alright
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed baby
But I should have known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with
Don't, don't want you back

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I, I don't want you back

You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go

That I could control this
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you, baby
Girl if only I knew what I've done
You know, so why don't you tell me
And I, I would bring down the moon and the sun
To show how much I care

Don't want to lose you now
Baby, I know we can win this
Don't want to lose you now
No no, or ever again

I've got this feeling you're not gonna stay
It's burning within me
The fear of losing
Of slipping away
It just keeps getting closer, baby
Whatever reason to leave that I've had
My place was always beside you
And I wish that I didn't need you so bad
Your face just won't go away

And find a way back to your heart (back to your heart)Here we are in the arms of one another
And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong and love is right
For us tonight

When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

Let it be (let it be) if we're nothing more than dreamers
Who believe (who believe) that we see no wall between us
How can they be in my heart (in my heart) and in my mind (in my mind)
When all I could find

When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

I loved you from a distance
Thought I couldn't reach that far
I can't believe how close that we are (believe how close we are, ooh ooh)
When I look into your Spanish eyes
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes (ooh yeah)When we turn out the lights
The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
But girl you know that I would never
Ever let another's touch
Come between the two of us

'Cause no one else will ever take your place

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder
You're my dream come true, oh yeah
Girl you know I'll always treasure
Every kiss and everyday 
I'll love you girl in every way
And I always will, 'cause in my eyes

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much

(Girl can't you see that) No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally, babe
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

No one else comes close
Oh girl, oh oh
No one else comes closeIt takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I want to thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
Be the perfect son

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

You showed me how to love (you showed me how to love)
You showed me how to care (you showed me how to care)
You showed me that you would
Always be there
I want to thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine

You showed me (you showed me)
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands

Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes

But I'll keep on trying, till the end 
Baby I need you back with me

And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I see 

And girl I'm going out of my mind 
I miss ya so much, I don't know what to do 
Please say its just a matter of time, 
Until I feel your touch, 
Until you let me come back to you 

I think about you girl every time at night 
I'm in love, and it feels so right 
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain 
I was just caught up in the lying game 
But now those days are over, I've changed my ways 
Now I'm counting the minutes, I'm counting the days 
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start 
To find a new way to get back into your heart 

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I seeBaby, can I talk to you?
I know something's wrong
Things just ain't the same
But deep down inside
I know you still care
So tell me what to do
To get things back
The way they used to be

If your words had meaning
If you really cared about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart

Nobody understands a man

I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't know)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (yeah)
As long as you love me
As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did (yeah)
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love meI don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know
But if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine!

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

To you, hey girl
Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
I Love You

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you
My love is all I have to give

My love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you

I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you[Chorus]
Oh baby I'm missing you 
We used the love so strong 
Tell me where do we go 
Oh baby I'm missing you 
They said I'd learn to forget but it sure ain't happen yet 

Been checkin' out the places where we used to go 
Been lookin' for your face inside the crowd 
I've been talkin' to the people what we used to know 
Nobody wants to say where you hang out

And when I call your phone 
Seems like you're never home 
And you don't return my call 
It tears me apart 
This is breakin' up my heart 

[Chorus]

I still have your pictures hung around my room 
That's the only thing that is left of you with me 
Girl what can I do to make you come back soon
And make it just the way it used to be

Oh, this is someone new 
Can never go on without you 
Girl I don't want to think about it 
I can't sleep at night 
No this can't be right 
Come back into my life 
(Come back baby come back) 

[Chorus]

I know there's a chance for you and I 
And I believe there's no way our love could die 
So no matter how long it takes I'll wait for you 
And what ever it takes I'll be there for you 
I'll be there, I'll be there 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]Hey, yeah
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
That's the way I like it
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)

Somebody told me that you're not my kind
So have I lost my mind? (That's the way I like it)
You keep on doing all the things I like
You've got me hypnotized
But that's the way I like it

Girl you make me wanna move
It's the price I got to pay
For all the things you do
But I like it
You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

Oh, mystery lady, you've got somethin' I like
Tell me you're here to stay (ooh yeah)
You're dangerous, oh baby
Could you do me right?
Will you come out to play?
'Cause that's the way I like it

Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now

Everybody come on

Everybody come on

You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
Hey, yeah!

That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it (everybody now)
That is the way I like it (everybody now)

(That's the way that, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)
(That's the way)Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh, what a life
Once we were dreamers just dreamers we were
Oh, you and I
Now I see you're just somebody who wastes all my time and money
What a lie, you and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

Once I could handle the truth
When the truth was you and I
But time after time all the
Promises turned out to be all lies
Now I see I'm just somebody who wasted my time and money
What a lie (what a lie, what a lie, oh)
You and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

You said "I'll take you back"
But I closed the door 'cause I don't want
10,000 more
Oh

10,000 promises yeah (oh)
10,000 promises you gave to me

Repeat chorus
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me (That you gave to me)
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me
Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh you and I
What a lieIf I could right the wrongs that made you cry 
I make a promise not to say good-night
"Cause I'm holding on 
With a love so strong
And I can't take a day without you by my side

Girl if i could change
If I could change your mind
Baby you could  help me wipe these tears from my eyes

[Chorus]
Girl don't stop
The sun from shining down on me 
'Cause  I can't face another day without your smile
And if you take away the love and arms that surround me 
The I might break down and cry just like a child

Girl,I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me
So I'm pressin' on
I hope you understand
There's a broken heart that lies inside your hands

So if I could change 
And it won't hurt your pride
Baby you could help me stop these tears that I cry

[Chorus]

Like a child 
Just like a child
With the spirits running free 
She showed my why
Oh, she did

Like a child(oh baby)
Just like a child
Think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
Like a child

[Chorus]do, da da da da
do, da da da da
do, da da da da

The candle plays the hourglass
Days go and all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
Every smile even all the reasons why
You say I pushed you out of my life

Chorus
Baby you set me (ha-ha-ahhh)
Baby you set me (do da da da da)
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you set me 
Set adrift on memory bliss

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with 
The biggest empty void 
I've ever had in life (ever had in life)
Bet you say that I don't care
Bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there 
when the mornin comes
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life)
Baby will you be there
When I open my eyes
After all the time I've spent 
Wishing you

Chorus

Sadness has overwhelmed me
my mind flies carelessly 
I Imagine that you're happy 
With your life right now
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things
That I could never have

Chorus to fade
The candle plays the hourglass
The days go and all I do is
Think of you and wonder where you are at night
Oh I remember everything
Every smile, and even all
The reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my life

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life (ever had in life) ohh
Bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there when the morning comes?
(Baby will you be there?)
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life, baby)
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes?
After all the time I've spent, wishing you

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind flies and carelessly
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now oh
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things that I can never have

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

So come on now
I know this much is true
I know this much is trueThere are people who say what you want to hear 
Even on a rainy day they'll tell you the sky is clear 
When you really, really love someone 
And I'm right when I say that you want them near 
And if you can't even tell 
Them things that they want to hear 

[Chorus]
Always forever, all the things she said 
Never say never, those simple lies that she fed 
I will never leave you 
All the love I thought she had 
But can you blame me, no, 
'Cause that's what she said 
That's what she said 
She told me we'd see forever 
That's what she said, she said, yeah 

And,
There are people who that say what they really mean 
She said she'd always be there 
She said she'd always care 
But just when you think that you can trust that someone ya love 
Tell me why do you know 
How stars can fall from above 

[Chorus]

'Cause you made promises that you couldn't keep 
But you're not hurting' yourself 
But you're only hurting me (you're only hurting me) 
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean 
Oh how can I make you see just-a what you did to me 

Oh, you said how much you really cared 
Just when I thought I was in love 
Girl, how could you dare 
If I were you I wouldn't lie not even-a once 
To the face of the one that I love so much 

[Chorus]

Oh that's what she saidIf you want it to be good girl
Get yourself a bad boy

Everything's gone  all went wrong
I wish you were here

You know I'd go
out of my mind
If you ever left
my heart behind
So I'm begging you please
Bring your sweet love back to me

If I don't have you

If I don't have youI may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

All of your time spent keeps us alive

All you people can't you see, can't you see

Yeah, and that's what makes you larger than life

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger
That makes you larger
That makes you larger than lifeYeah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way

Am I, your fire?
Your one, desire

But I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way

Now I can see that we've fallen apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

You are my fire
The one desire
You are (you are, you are, you are)

I never want to hear you say (never want to hear you say it)
I want it that way

'Cause I want it that wayShow me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze upon me
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be
You're asking me
To feel the things you never show

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are (where you are)
There's something missing in my heart

Show me the meaning of being lonely (being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are (where you are)
There's something missing in my heartBaby, it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop
It's gotta be you (uh huh, uh huh, yeah)

I can't control it anymore
I've never felt like this before
Mmm, you really make me lose my head
My hungry heart must be fed (uh huh, uh huh)

Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop

It's gotta be you (uh huh, uh huh)
All the way
It's gotta be you (uh huh, uh huh)
Everyday
I promise you I will be true, yeah
It's only you

Now I know why I was born
You feel my feelings one by one

You saw my picture
On the Backstreet's Back, alright

Another victim of your sexuality

Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I, I don't want you back

You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies

Don't want you back

To show how much I care

The fear of losing
Of slipping away

And find a way back to your heart (back to your heart)Here we are in the arms of one another
And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong and love is right
For us tonight

When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

Let it be (let it be) if we're nothing more than dreamers
Who believe (who believe) that we see no wall between us
How can they be in my heart (in my heart) and in my mind (in my mind)
When all I could find

When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

I loved you from a distance
Thought I couldn't reach that far
I can't believe how close that we are (believe how close we are, ooh ooh)
When I look into your Spanish eyes
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes (ooh yeah)When we turn out the lights
The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
But girl you know that I would never
Ever let another's touch
Come between the two of us

'Cause no one else will ever take your place

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder
You're my dream come true, oh yeah
Girl you know I'll always treasure
Every kiss and everyday 
I'll love you girl in every way
And I always will, 'cause in my eyes

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much

(Girl can't you see that) No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally, babe
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

No one else comes close
Oh girl, oh oh
No one else comes closeIt takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I want to thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
Be the perfect son

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

You showed me how to love (you showed me how to love)
You showed me how to care (you showed me how to care)
You showed me that you would
Always be there
I want to thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine

You showed me (you showed me)
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

'Cause mom you always were

You know you always were
'Cause mom you always were, the perfect fan

I love you mom"Hello"
"Hi, it's me, what's up, baby?
I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight
So don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"Say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really dropping out
I think my battery must be low
Listen, if you can hear me
We're going to a place nearby, alright?
Gotta go!"

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should've said, "No, someone's waiting for me"
But I called my girl up and said

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Listen, baby, I'm sorry (hello?)
Listen, baby, I'm sorry (hello?)
Gotta go

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
Gotta go

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"Yeah, yeah

Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become, oh yeah

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful, loneliness that's tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (trying)
I played my part, kept you in the dark (in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark (keep you in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (trying to be someone)
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart (now let me show you the shape of my heart)

Check it uh
Hey

Let's talk about one, baby
You gotta hear me out
Did you really think I'd be the last to know
What it's all about

Let's talk about you
You say 
He's the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't want to know

I'm tellin' you he'll eat you up from inside
And then he doesn't want to know

[Chorus]
Listen I mean it
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another player
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

Let's talk about what he's done (he's done)
To become your number one
Or was it all the promises of diamonds, pearls and party dresses
That turn you on
I've seen it before (dont take!)
Anymore, free too
You're through for sure
Just go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up
I'm tellin' you to go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up

Listen I mean it (I mean it)
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another player (player)
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end (must come to an end)
Get another boyfriend

All right 
Yeah
Get another boyfriend
Stop
Hey

Hear me out
You must know (you must know)
What it's all about (baby)
That he's just a player in love (love)
This must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

[Chorus: x2][Chorus]
You're my shining star
That is what you are
There is no one like you baby
Angels everywhere
Every time you're near
You will always be my baby

Baby when you do the things you do
I want to be close to you
Cause I need to feel your every move, oh
Baby I can never say how much
I need your touch, I can't get enough
Cause you know what to do to turn me on, yeah

[Chorus]

Baby you're as close as close can get
And baby you know I'd let
Every single part of me be yours, ooh yeah
It doesn't matter if the phone might ring
Cause I won't hear a thing when I'm in your arms
Cause you know what to do to turn me on

[Chorus]

I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
Cause you are doing everything so right
Oh, oh baby
I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
Cause you are doing everything so right
Oh, oh baby

[Chorus]

You know that I adore you
want to be there everyday for you
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby
You know that I adore you
want to be there everyday for you
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby

[Chorus]It's in the silences, the words you never say
I see it in your eyes, always starts the same way
It seems like everyone we know is breaking up
Does anybody ever stay in love, anymore?

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

I see you look at me when you think I'm not aware
You're searching for clues of just how deep my feelings are
How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide?
All I know is what I feel when I look into your eyes

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything that I am

Oh, there are no guarantees
That's what you always say to me
But late at night I feel the tremble in your touch
But what I'm trying to say to you
I've never said to anyone

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

You're everything I am
With everything I am
You see me sitting here
A smile upon my face
The time has come but you know that it's not too late
There's been too many things
Together we have seen
It's not that hard if we start to believe
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

This world is not at ease
We seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only so much we can really do
It's up to you and me
To fix our destiny
The jury's here, so let's take the stand
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

So tell me why we have to cry (and not try)
When there's so many things we can do
To help this troubled world start anew

I need a reason, I need a sign
There's no turning back, I'm here by your side
Is it today or maybe tonight, we'll find
The answer to our life

Show me the way
Give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today, is it tonight
The answer to our life

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our lifeWe've been through days of thunder
Some people say we don't belong
They try to pull us under
But here we stand together in the new year strong

Let's get on with the show
(Let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are
And this one goes out to

[Chorus]
Everyone (yeah) , everyone, everyone
This one goes out to you,
Everyone
We're standing stronger 'cause' of what you've done
This one goes out to you

We've been inside the circus
We take the pleasure with the pain
I guess there's something about us
Whatever comes around will always stay the same
Oh yeah 

Let's get on with the show
(Oh let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are 
(we know who you are)

[Chorus]

Now we're minutes away
Till it's time to play
Our heartbeats are rising
They're letting you in
Time for the show to begin

Here
We're standing stronger from what you've done
This one goes out to you, you, you
You make us feel like we've just begun
And this one goes out to you... yeah

[Chorus: x2]I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
What's the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong
I heard him promise you forever
But forever's come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines, oh

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than that

Baby, you deserve much better
What's the use in holding on
Don't you see it's now or never
'Cause I just can't be friends
Baby knowing in the end, that

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

There's not a day that passes by
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
It's not too late to change your mind
So take my hand, don't say goodbye

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than that

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than thatI know that I
I can't believe
Just what the path has brought me
To the man I want to be
And I know that we
Have had some times
That we can't forget the struggle
Cause we have so far to go

I know we have changed
But change can be so good
So lets not forget why it's understood
That

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through
Time (time)
Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)
Time
(goes on and on) Goes on and on everyday
Baby time is what is, come what may

I remember when
Mom used to say
That things are getting better
And you'll soon be on your way
Remember those days
That we would sing at the drop of a dime
Way back when nothing else mattered

I know we have changed
But change can be so good
So lets not forget why it's understood
That

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through

To you (time goes on, it never stops, it keeps on)

I was looking for something
On the crime scene where you're in too deep
I found a note with his number
It's just another clue (that leads to you)

I got a little suspicious
I got a feeling that you ain't true to me
I should've known better
Than to buy your lie (your sweet disguise)

Yeah
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see

Now give me the story
On baby who's to blame (maybe I am)
Caught in the middle
And I'm tired of your games of hide and seek
I'm getting a feeling
That it's time for me to leave

'Cause I want you back again 

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I see 

You and I we shared enough together 
Each other was all we'd ever need 
I thought that you would stay with me forever 
But I took for granted the love you gave to me 
But I'll keep on trying, till the end 
Baby I need you back with me 
I need you back

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I see 

And girl I'm going out of my mind 
I miss ya so much, I don't know what to do 
Please say its just a matter of time, 
Until I feel your touch, 
Until you let me come back to you 

I think about you girl every time at night 
I'm in love, and it feels so right 
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain 
I was just caught up in the lying game 
But now those days are over, I've changed my ways 
Now I'm counting the minutes, I'm counting the days 
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start 
To find a new way to get back into your heart 

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I seeBaby, can I talk to you?
I know something's wrong
Things just ain't the same
But deep down inside
I know you still care
So tell me what to do
To get things back
The way they used to be

If your words had meaning
If you really cared about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart
If you were my lover
A constant friend to me
Tell me why
Would you turn away from my love

I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't know)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (yeah)
As long as you love me
As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did (yeah)
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love meI don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know
But if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine!

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

To you, hey girl
Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
I Love You

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you
My love is all I have to give

My love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you

I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you[Chorus]
Oh baby I'm missing you 
We used the love so strong 
Tell me where do we go 
Oh baby I'm missing you 
They said I'd learn to forget but it sure ain't happen yet 

Been checkin' out the places where we used to go 
Been lookin' for your face inside the crowd 
I've been talkin' to the people what we used to know 
Nobody wants to say where you hang out

And when I call your phone 
Seems like you're never home 
And you don't return my call 
It tears me apart 
This is breakin' up my heart 

[Chorus]

I still have your pictures hung around my room 
That's the only thing that is left of you with me 
Girl what can I do to make you come back soon
And make it just the way it used to be

Oh, this is someone new 
Can never go on without you 
Girl I don't want to think about it 
I can't sleep at night 
No this can't be right 
Come back into my life 
(Come back baby come back) 

[Chorus]

I know there's a chance for you and I 
And I believe there's no way our love could die 
So no matter how long it takes I'll wait for you 
And what ever it takes I'll be there for you 
I'll be there, I'll be there 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]Hey, yeah
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
That's the way I like it
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)

Somebody told me that you're not my kind
So have I lost my mind? (That's the way I like it)
You keep on doing all the things I like
You've got me hypnotized
But that's the way I like it

Girl you make me wanna move
It's the price I got to pay
For all the things you do
But I like it
You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

Oh, mystery lady, you've got somethin' I like
Tell me you're here to stay (ooh yeah)
You're dangerous, oh baby
Could you do me right?
Will you come out to play?
'Cause that's the way I like it

Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)

Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on

You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
Hey, yeah!

That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it (everybody now)
That is the way I like it (everybody now)
That's the way that I like it (everybody come on)
That is the way I like it (everybody come on)
That's the way I like it

That is the way I like it

(That's the way that, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)
(That's the way)Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh, what a life
Once we were dreamers just dreamers we were
Oh, you and I
Now I see you're just somebody who wastes all my time and money
What a lie, you and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

Once I could handle the truth
When the truth was you and I
But time after time all the
Promises turned out to be all lies
Now I see I'm just somebody who wasted my time and money
What a lie (what a lie, what a lie, oh)
You and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

You said "I'll take you back"
But I closed the door 'cause I don't want
10,000 more
Oh

10,000 promises yeah (oh)
10,000 promises you gave to me

Repeat chorus
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me (That you gave to me)
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me
Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh you and I
What a lieIf I could right the wrongs that made you cry 
I make a promise not to say good-night
"Cause I'm holding on 
With a love so strong
And I can't take a day without you by my side

Girl if i could change
If I could change your mind
Baby you could  help me wipe these tears from my eyes

[Chorus]
Girl don't stop
The sun from shining down on me 
'Cause  I can't face another day without your smile
And if you take away the love and arms that surround me 
The I might break down and cry just like a child

Girl,I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me
So I'm pressin' on
I hope you understand
There's a broken heart that lies inside your hands

So if I could change 
And it won't hurt your pride
Baby you could help me stop these tears that I cry

[Chorus]

Like a child 
Just like a child
With the spirits running free 
She showed my why
Oh, she did

Like a child(oh baby)
Just like a child
Think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
Like a child

[Chorus]do, da da da da
do, da da da da
do, da da da da

The candle plays the hourglass
Days go and all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
Every smile even all the reasons why
You say I pushed you out of my life

Chorus
Baby you set me (ha-ha-ahhh)
Baby you set me (do da da da da)
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you set me 
Set adrift on memory bliss

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with 
The biggest empty void 
I've ever had in life (ever had in life)
Bet you say that I don't care
Bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there 
when the mornin comes
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life)
Baby will you be there
When I open my eyes
After all the time I've spent 
Wishing you

Chorus

Sadness has overwhelmed me
my mind flies carelessly 
I Imagine that you're happy 
With your life right now
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things
That I could never have

Chorus to fade
The candle plays the hourglass
The days go and all I do is
Think of you and wonder where you are at night
Oh I remember everything
Every smile, and even all
The reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my life

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life (ever had in life) ohh
Bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there when the morning comes?
(Baby will you be there?)
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life, baby)
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes?
After all the time I've spent, wishing you

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind flies and carelessly
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now oh
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things that I can never have

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

So come on now
I know this much is true
I know this much is trueThere are people who say what you want to hear 
Even on a rainy day they'll tell you the sky is clear 
When you really, really love someone 
And I'm right when I say that you want them near 
And if you can't even tell 
Them things that they want to hear 

[Chorus]
Always forever, all the things she said 
Never say never, those simple lies that she fed 
I will never leave you 
All the love I thought she had 
But can you blame me, no, 
'Cause that's what she said 
That's what she said 
She told me we'd see forever 
That's what she said, she said, yeah 

And,
There are people who that say what they really mean 
She said she'd always be there 
She said she'd always care 
But just when you think that you can trust that someone ya love 
Tell me why do you know 
How stars can fall from above 

[Chorus]

'Cause you made promises that you couldn't keep 
But you're not hurting' yourself 
But you're only hurting me (you're only hurting me) 
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean 
Oh how can I make you see just-a what you did to me 

Oh, you said how much you really cared 
Just when I thought I was in love 
Girl, how could you dare 
If I were you I wouldn't lie not even-a once 
To the face of the one that I love so much 

[Chorus]

Oh that's what she saidIf you want it to be good girl
Get yourself a bad boy
(Yeah I like this, ha ha)

If you want it to be wild
Gotta know just who to dial baby (that's me)
If you really like it hot
Find someone who hits the spot honey (oh yes)

And if you want to get it done
Babe you gotta get the one
The one who's got it goin' on
If you wanna make it last
Gotta know just who to ask
Babe he's gotta be the best (tonight it's me)

When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive

You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say

That deep down inside of me

You are my fire
The one desire
You are (you are, you are, you are)

'Cause I want it that wayShow me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze upon me
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be
You're asking me
To feel the things you never show

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are (where you are)
There's something missing in my heart

You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture
On the Backstreet's Back, alright
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed baby
But I should have known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with

'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I, I don't want you back

You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know

To show how much I care

Don't want to lose you now
Baby, I know we can win this

It's burning within me
The fear of losing
Of slipping away
It just keeps getting closer, baby

Your face just won't go away

And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong and love is right
For us tonight

When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

Let it be (let it be) if we're nothing more than dreamers
Who believe (who believe) that we see no wall between us
How can they be in my heart (in my heart) and in my mind (in my mind)
When all I could find

The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
But girl you know that I would never
Ever let another's touch
Come between the two of us

'Cause no one else will ever take your place

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder

Oh girl, oh oh
No one else comes closeIt takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I want to thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
Be the perfect son

I love you mom"Hello"
"Hi, it's me, what's up, baby?
I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight
So don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"Say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really dropping out
I think my battery must be low
Listen, if you can hear me
We're going to a place nearby, alright?
Gotta go!"

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should've said, "No, someone's waiting for me"
But I called my girl up and said

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Listen, baby, I'm sorry (hello?)
Listen, baby, I'm sorry (hello?)
Gotta go

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
Gotta go

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"Yeah, yeah

Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become, oh yeah

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful, loneliness that's tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (trying)
I played my part, kept you in the dark (in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark (keep you in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (trying to be someone)
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart (now let me show you the shape of my heart)
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone 
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of

Show you the shape of my heartBackstreet
Check it uh
Hey

Let's talk about one, baby
You gotta hear me out
Did you really think I'd be the last to know
What it's all about

Let's talk about you
You say 
He's the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't want to know

I'm tellin' you he'll eat you up from inside
And then he doesn't want to know

[Chorus]
Listen I mean it
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another player
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

Let's talk about what he's done (he's done)
To become your number one
Or was it all the promises of diamonds, pearls and party dresses
That turn you on
I've seen it before (dont take!)
Anymore, free too
You're through for sure
Just go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up
I'm tellin' you to go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up

Listen I mean it (I mean it)
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another player (player)
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end (must come to an end)
Get another boyfriend

All right 
Yeah
Get another boyfriend
Stop
Hey

Hear me out
You must know (you must know)
What it's all about (baby)
That he's just a player in love (love)
This must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

[Chorus: x2][Chorus]
You're my shining star
That is what you are
There is no one like you baby
Angels everywhere
Every time you're near
You will always be my baby

Baby when you do the things you do
I want to be close to you
Cause I need to feel your every move, oh
Baby I can never say how much
I need your touch, I can't get enough
Cause you know what to do to turn me on, yeah

[Chorus]

Baby you're as close as close can get
And baby you know I'd let
Every single part of me be yours, ooh yeah
It doesn't matter if the phone might ring
Cause I won't hear a thing when I'm in your arms
Cause you know what to do to turn me on

[Chorus]

I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
Cause you are doing everything so right
Oh, oh baby
I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
Cause you are doing everything so right
Oh, oh baby

[Chorus]

You know that I adore you
want to be there everyday for you
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby
You know that I adore you
want to be there everyday for you
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby

[Chorus]It's in the silences, the words you never say
I see it in your eyes, always starts the same way
It seems like everyone we know is breaking up
Does anybody ever stay in love, anymore?

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

I see you look at me when you think I'm not aware
You're searching for clues of just how deep my feelings are
How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide?
All I know is what I feel when I look into your eyes

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything that I am

Oh, there are no guarantees
That's what you always say to me
But late at night I feel the tremble in your touch
But what I'm trying to say to you
I've never said to anyone

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

You're everything I am
With everything I am
You see me sitting here
A smile upon my face
The time has come but you know that it's not too late
There's been too many things
Together we have seen
It's not that hard if we start to believe
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

This world is not at ease
We seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only so much we can really do
It's up to you and me
To fix our destiny
The jury's here, so let's take the stand
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

So tell me why we have to cry (and not try)
When there's so many things we can do
To help this troubled world start anew

I need a reason, I need a sign
There's no turning back, I'm here by your side
Is it today or maybe tonight, we'll find
The answer to our life

Show me the way
Give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today, is it tonight
The answer to our life

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our lifeWe've been through days of thunder
Some people say we don't belong
They try to pull us under
But here we stand together in the new year strong

Let's get on with the show
(Let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are
And this one goes out to

[Chorus]
Everyone (yeah) , everyone, everyone
This one goes out to you,
Everyone
We're standing stronger 'cause' of what you've done
This one goes out to you

We've been inside the circus
We take the pleasure with the pain
I guess there's something about us
Whatever comes around will always stay the same
Oh yeah 

Let's get on with the show
(Oh let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are 
(we know who you are)

[Chorus]

Now we're minutes away
Till it's time to play
Our heartbeats are rising
They're letting you in
Time for the show to begin

Here
We're standing stronger from what you've done
This one goes out to you, you, you
You make us feel like we've just begun
And this one goes out to you... yeah

[Chorus: x2]I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
What's the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong
I heard him promise you forever
But forever's come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines, oh

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than that

Baby, you deserve much better
What's the use in holding on
Don't you see it's now or never
'Cause I just can't be friends
Baby knowing in the end, that

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

There's not a day that passes by
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
It's not too late to change your mind
So take my hand, don't say goodbye

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than that

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than thatI know that I
I can't believe
Just what the path has brought me
To the man I want to be
And I know that we
Have had some times
That we can't forget the struggle
Cause we have so far to go

I know we have changed
But change can be so good
So lets not forget why it's understood
That

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through
Time (time)
Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)
Time
(goes on and on) Goes on and on everyday
Baby time is what is, come what may

I remember when
Mom used to say
That things are getting better
And you'll soon be on your way
Remember those days
That we would sing at the drop of a dime
Way back when nothing else mattered

I know we have changed
But change can be so good
So lets not forget why it's understood
That

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through

To you (time goes on, it never stops, it keeps on)

I was looking for something
On the crime scene where you're in too deep
I found a note with his number
It's just another clue (that leads to you)

I got a little suspicious
I got a feeling that you ain't true to me
I should've known better
Than to buy your lie (your sweet disguise)

Yeah
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
that you're not for me babe

No no, uh uh
Things will never be the same again with you
No no, uh uh

That love should be
Let me tell you it's not for me

No no

I don't want to be part of your screenplay
Just tell me
Did you rehearse on me?
Now give me the story
On baby who's to blame (maybe I am)
Caught in the middle
And I'm tired of your games of hide and seek
I'm getting a feeling
That it's time for me to leave

You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
That you're not for me babe

From the bottom of my heart.

It's true.Remember when
Never needed each other
The best of friends
Like sister and brother
We understood
We'd never be alone

Those days are gone
Now I want you so much
The night is long
And I need your touch
Don't know what to say
Never meant to feel this way
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

I hear your voice
And I start to tremble
Brings back the child that
I resemble

I cannot pretend
That we can still be friends
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

I want to say this right
And it has to be tonight
Just need you to know

I don't want to live this life
I don't want to say goodbye
With you I want to spend
The rest of my life

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
Everything's changed
We never knew
How did I fall in love with youEmpty spaces fill me up with hopes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me I can't find no rest
Where I'm going is anybody's guess

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't want to make you face this world alone
I want to let you go

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

IncompleteLooking at your picture from when we first met
You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night

Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

All the doors are closing I'm tryin' to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day, the day you slipped away

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

That since I lost you, I lost myself
No I can't fake it, there's no one else

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to knowEverybody knows that I was such a fool to ever let go of you
And baby I was wrong
And yeah I know I said we'd be better off alone
It was time that we moved on
I know I broke your heart, I didn't mean to break your heart

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you.

I know you aren't there and you can make me wait, but I'm not gonna wait
It's the that least I could do, just to tell you face to face
I was lying to myself, now I'm dying in this hell
Girl I know you're mad
I can't blame you for being mad

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and now I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you

If you could see these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
Hear the heart that's barely beating, you would see a different man

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to youHey hey hey

The sun is over the city but it's an orange day
There is reason for lookin' up but I'm feelin' down
You see, I've got to catch a plane but won't buy a ticket
'Cause its' hard to just stop when you're spinnin' around

It's a weird world, don't you know it?
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world, no matter how you roll it

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love
It's a weird world, yeah

Sent a message to a G.I. in the desert
Said thank you man for bringin' another dawn
Back here it's her and me and we're havin' our first baby
He's out there takin' 'em on

It's a weird world and I know you know it
It's a weird world and it won't slow down

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way

Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love

I'm closin' my eyes but I'm startin' to see
While he's lookin' at you, she's lookin' at me
The only thing it does
Is just keep me away from you

Sure, part of this place would cheer if I die
But don't let them take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey, sweet baby

Julie was a long way from home
She can make alone look pretty
Her attitude made a part of her landscape
Riding her bike through alphabet city

She likes to party in the backseat, under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise
She said "what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
She can lick her lips and smile and make you want to believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl
(Right now right now ooh ooh ooh)

Julie likes to shop lift in stores
Right alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stop
And make love on the floor until the camera made us

And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire
When she walked, I followed, when she laughed, I cried,
"What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
And I was wrapped around her finger, and I began to believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Tell me what you want from me
I've got everything you need
It's getting hard for me to breathe
Let me be your guarantee

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (a game)
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day (by day)
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl (poster girl)

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (just a game)
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Right now, right now
Right now, oh oh oh
Poster girl
Poster girl
Come on, come onOh, no

Take what you need 'cause I can't hold my breath
Say what you feel 'cause I've got nothing left, oh
I made a promise to myself last night
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

It wouldn't matter anyway, don't change a thing
You're perfect as you are, time has a way, time is all I've got
If my heart should shatter watching you
There'd be one less thing I'd have to prove

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

Heaven will be waiting when I fall into your lovely arms
I believe you'll find me there
You'll find me there

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'll take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

Wouldn't matter, anywayClose your eyes, make a wish
That this could last forever
If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now

Yeah, it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

Take my hand, take my life
Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain kept inside, yeah
There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now

Yeah, it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

It's an illusion
How can I feel this way if I can't have you?
It's an illusion
Nothing is real this way if I can't have you

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
(I don't wanna know)
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
(I'm climbing the walls)
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

I can't let you go, no

And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss, I miss youNo no baby 
How can I begin to tell you 
What you do to me every time I hear ya 
More willing to want to see ya 
I know that there's no use in 
Tryin' to explain the confusion 
But still I'm not complainin' 
'Bout my situation 
Let's not talk about a possible ending 

The very first time that I 
was lookin' to be your fella 
I found my inspiration 
hidin' in your expression 
So I put myself on forward 
for your consideration 

[Chorus]
Let's not talk about a possible ending 
Let's not think about it every day 
And I know I'm so in love with you 
I'm finding it harder and harder to breathe 
Every time I'm near a beautiful woman 

And so we put the top down 
To take you drivin' downtown 
I guess we'll know just what to do 
When you're lookin' to fool around 
It's too late to stop me 
I know we're gonna get down, get down, oh no 

[Chorus] 

My beautiful woman 
My beautiful woman 
Yes you are, yes you are 
My beautiful woman 
Anything that you want me to, I'll do 
My beautiful

be	 is for beautiful as the sunshine 
E tells me everything's feelin' alright 
A goes to you and me swingin' it down 
T is two, I want you 
You've got me actin' like a fool 

[Chorus: x2]

My beautiful woman 
My beautiful woman 
Yes you are, yes you are 
My beautiful woman 
You're so beautiful 
My beautiful woman 
My beautiful womanYeah, yeah 
It seems like yesterday when I said "I do" 
And after all this time my heart still burns for you 
If you don't know by now that you're my only one 
Take a look inside me and watch my heartstrings come undone 

I know I promised you forever 
Is there no stronger word I can use 
To reassure you when the storm is raging outside 
You're my safest place to hide 

Can you see me, here I am 
I need you like I needed you then 
When I feel like giving up 
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine 
You're my safest place to hide 

You see colors no one else can see 
In every breath you hear a symphony 
You understand me like nobody can 
I feel like my soul unfolding like a flower blooming 

When this whole world gets too crazy 
And there's nowhere left to go 
I know you give me sanctuary 
You're the only truth I know 
You're the road back home 

Can you see me, here I am 
Standing here where I've always been 
And when words are not enough 
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine 
You're my safest place to hide 
My safest place to hide 

I know I promised you forever 
There's no stronger word I can use 
To reassure when the storm is raging outside 
You're my safest place to hide 

Oh! Can you see me, here I am 
Standing here where I've always been 
When I feel like giving up 
I promise inside your heart I'd still find 
Yeah, yeah 
You're my safest place to hide, oh yeah 
You're my safest place to hideWhen you come back I won't be here
She said and gently pulled me near
If you want to talk you can call
I know it's not your fault

I just smiled and said let go of me
But there's something that I've just gotta know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said it's not my fault

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been

Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head

When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too
When the one that you want doesn't want you

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

Siberia, Siberia
When the one you want doesn't want you tooI really miss you
There's something that I gotta say

The things we did,
the things we said,
Keep coming back to me and make me smile again.
You showed me how to face the truth.
Everything that's good in me, I owe to you.

Though the distance that's between us now, may seem to be too far.
It will never separate us, deep inside I know you are

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)
Never Gone

No, no, no

I walk along these empty streets.
There is not a second you're not here with me.
The love you gave, the grace you've shown,
Will always give me strength and be my corner stone.
Some how you found a way to see the best I have in me.
As long as time goes on, I swear to you that you will be

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)

Never gone from me
If there's one thing I believe
I believe
I will see you somewhere down the road again.

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)
Never Gone

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)

To your heart (baby to your heart, heart)

Will never part (will never part) 
I want you to be the only thing that I see 
'cause I believe it's our destiny

Just to be close, just to be close 
It's the only thing that I want to do 
Just to be close, just to be close 
Just to be close to ya (closer to ya)

I'm looking for a sign
In the things you do
I want to be with you
And I'll be waitin'
Until you face the truth
When the light is fadin'
You know what I want to do

I want to be with you
It's crazy but it's true
And everything I do
I want to be with youListen girl, I don't know where to start 
'Cause every word I say is straight from the heart 
I've been so wrong, I've never meant to hurt you 
Oh girl, I'm sorry of what I put you through 
Girl I'd do anything for one more chance
'Cause I want you back again 

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I see 

You and I we shared enough together 
Each other was all we'd ever need 
I thought that you would stay with me forever 
But I took for granted the love you gave to me 
But I'll keep on trying, till the end 
Baby I need you back with me 
I need you back

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I see 

And girl I'm going out of my mind 
I miss ya so much, I don't know what to do 
Please say its just a matter of time, 
Until I feel your touch, 
Until you let me come back to you 

I think about you girl every time at night 
I'm in love, and it feels so right 
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain 
I was just caught up in the lying game 
But now those days are over, I've changed my ways 
Now I'm counting the minutes, I'm counting the days 
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start 
To find a new way to get back into your heart 

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I seeBaby, can I talk to you?
I know something's wrong
Things just ain't the same
But deep down inside
I know you still care
So tell me what to do
To get things back
The way they used to be

If your words had meaning
If you really cared about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart
If you were my lover
A constant friend to me
Tell me why
Would you turn away from my love

I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't know)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (yeah)
As long as you love me
As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did (yeah)
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love meI don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know
But if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine!

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

To you, hey girl
Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
I Love You

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you
My love is all I have to give

My love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you

I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you[Chorus]
Oh baby I'm missing you 
We used the love so strong 
Tell me where do we go 
Oh baby I'm missing you 
They said I'd learn to forget but it sure ain't happen yet 

Been checkin' out the places where we used to go 
Been lookin' for your face inside the crowd 
I've been talkin' to the people what we used to know 
Nobody wants to say where you hang out

And when I call your phone 
Seems like you're never home 
And you don't return my call 
It tears me apart 
This is breakin' up my heart 

[Chorus]

I still have your pictures hung around my room 
That's the only thing that is left of you with me 
Girl what can I do to make you come back soon
And make it just the way it used to be

Oh, this is someone new 
Can never go on without you 
Girl I don't want to think about it 
I can't sleep at night 
No this can't be right 
Come back into my life 
(Come back baby come back) 

[Chorus]

I know there's a chance for you and I 
And I believe there's no way our love could die 
So no matter how long it takes I'll wait for you 
And what ever it takes I'll be there for you 
I'll be there, I'll be there 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]Hey, yeah
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
That's the way I like it
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)

Somebody told me that you're not my kind
So have I lost my mind? (That's the way I like it)
You keep on doing all the things I like
You've got me hypnotized
But that's the way I like it

Girl you make me wanna move
It's the price I got to pay
For all the things you do
But I like it
You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

Oh, mystery lady, you've got somethin' I like
Tell me you're here to stay (ooh yeah)
You're dangerous, oh baby
Could you do me right?
Will you come out to play?
'Cause that's the way I like it

Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on

Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)

Everybody come on

Everybody come on

You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
Hey, yeah!

That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it (everybody now)
That is the way I like it (everybody now)
That's the way that I like it (everybody come on)
That is the way I like it (everybody come on)
That's the way I like it

(That's the way that, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)
(That's the way)Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh, what a life
Once we were dreamers just dreamers we were
Oh, you and I
Now I see you're just somebody who wastes all my time and money
What a lie, you and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

Once I could handle the truth
When the truth was you and I
But time after time all the
Promises turned out to be all lies
Now I see I'm just somebody who wasted my time and money
What a lie (what a lie, what a lie, oh)
You and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

You said "I'll take you back"
But I closed the door 'cause I don't want
10,000 more
Oh

10,000 promises yeah (oh)
10,000 promises you gave to me

Repeat chorus
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me (That you gave to me)
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me
Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh you and I
What a lieIf I could right the wrongs that made you cry 
I make a promise not to say good-night
"Cause I'm holding on 
With a love so strong
And I can't take a day without you by my side

Girl if i could change
If I could change your mind
Baby you could  help me wipe these tears from my eyes

[Chorus]
Girl don't stop
The sun from shining down on me 
'Cause  I can't face another day without your smile
And if you take away the love and arms that surround me 
The I might break down and cry just like a child

Girl,I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me
So I'm pressin' on
I hope you understand
There's a broken heart that lies inside your hands

So if I could change 
And it won't hurt your pride
Baby you could help me stop these tears that I cry

[Chorus]

Like a child 
Just like a child
With the spirits running free 
She showed my why
Oh, she did

Like a child(oh baby)
Just like a child
Think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
Like a child

[Chorus]do, da da da da
do, da da da da
do, da da da da

The candle plays the hourglass
Days go and all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
Every smile even all the reasons why
You say I pushed you out of my life

Chorus
Baby you set me (ha-ha-ahhh)
Baby you set me (do da da da da)
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you set me 
Set adrift on memory bliss

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with 
The biggest empty void 
I've ever had in life (ever had in life)
Bet you say that I don't care
Bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there 
when the mornin comes
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life)
Baby will you be there
When I open my eyes
After all the time I've spent 
Wishing you

Chorus

Sadness has overwhelmed me
my mind flies carelessly 
I Imagine that you're happy 
With your life right now
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things
That I could never have

Chorus to fade
The candle plays the hourglass
The days go and all I do is
Think of you and wonder where you are at night
Oh I remember everything
Every smile, and even all
The reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my life

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life (ever had in life) ohh
Bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there when the morning comes?
(Baby will you be there?)
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life, baby)
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes?
After all the time I've spent, wishing you

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind flies and carelessly
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now oh
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things that I can never have

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

So come on now
I know this much is true
I know this much is trueThere are people who say what you want to hear 
Even on a rainy day they'll tell you the sky is clear 
When you really, really love someone 
And I'm right when I say that you want them near 
And if you can't even tell 
Them things that they want to hear 

[Chorus]
Always forever, all the things she said 
Never say never, those simple lies that she fed 
I will never leave you 
All the love I thought she had 
But can you blame me, no, 
'Cause that's what she said 
That's what she said 
She told me we'd see forever 
That's what she said, she said, yeah 

And,
There are people who that say what they really mean 
She said she'd always be there 
She said she'd always care 
But just when you think that you can trust that someone ya love 
Tell me why do you know 
How stars can fall from above 

[Chorus]

'Cause you made promises that you couldn't keep 
But you're not hurting' yourself 
But you're only hurting me (you're only hurting me) 
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean 
Oh how can I make you see just-a what you did to me 

Oh, you said how much you really cared 
Just when I thought I was in love 
Girl, how could you dare 
If I were you I wouldn't lie not even-a once 
To the face of the one that I love so much 

[Chorus]

Oh that's what she saidIf you want it to be good girl
Get yourself a bad boy
(Yeah I like this, ha ha)

If you want it to be wild
Gotta know just who to dial baby (that's me)
If you really like it hot
Find someone who hits the spot honey (oh yes)

And if you want to get it done
Babe you gotta get the one
The one who's got it goin' on
If you wanna make it last
Gotta know just who to ask
Babe he's gotta be the best (tonight it's me)

If you want it to be good girl
Get yourself a bad boy
If you really want it good girl
Get yourself a bad boy
Get it like it could be, would be
Yeah like it should be
If you want it to be good girl
Get yourself a bad boy

If you like it innovative
Better get someone creative honey (yes)

There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon

You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why

So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze upon me
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be
You're asking me
To feel the things you never show

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are (where you are)
There's something missing in my heart

You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture
On the Backstreet's Back, alright
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed baby
But I should have known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with

'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I, I don't want you back

You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back

To show how much I care

Don't want to lose you now
Baby, I know we can win this
Don't want to lose you now

It's burning within me
The fear of losing
Of slipping away
It just keeps getting closer, baby

My place was always beside you
And I wish that I didn't need you so bad
Your face just won't go away

And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong and love is right
For us tonight

When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

Let it be (let it be) if we're nothing more than dreamers
Who believe (who believe) that we see no wall between us
How can they be in my heart (in my heart) and in my mind (in my mind)
When all I could find

The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
But girl you know that I would never
Ever let another's touch
Come between the two of us

'Cause no one else will ever take your place

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder

Oh girl, oh oh
No one else comes closeIt takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I want to thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
Be the perfect son

I love you mom"Hello"
"Hi, it's me, what's up, baby?
I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight
So don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"Say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really dropping out
I think my battery must be low
Listen, if you can hear me
We're going to a place nearby, alright?
Gotta go!"

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should've said, "No, someone's waiting for me"
But I called my girl up and said

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Listen, baby, I'm sorry (hello?)
Listen, baby, I'm sorry (hello?)
Gotta go

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
Gotta go

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"Yeah, yeah

Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become, oh yeah

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful, loneliness that's tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (trying)
I played my part, kept you in the dark (in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark (keep you in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (trying to be someone)
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart (now let me show you the shape of my heart)
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone 
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of

Show you the shape of my heartBackstreet
Check it uh
Hey

Let's talk about one, baby
You gotta hear me out
Did you really think I'd be the last to know
What it's all about

Let's talk about you
You say 
He's the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't want to know

I'm tellin' you he'll eat you up from inside
And then he doesn't want to know

[Chorus]
Listen I mean it
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another player
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

Let's talk about what he's done (he's done)
To become your number one
Or was it all the promises of diamonds, pearls and party dresses
That turn you on
I've seen it before (dont take!)
Anymore, free too
You're through for sure
Just go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up
I'm tellin' you to go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up

Listen I mean it (I mean it)
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another player (player)
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end (must come to an end)
Get another boyfriend

All right 
Yeah
Get another boyfriend
Stop
Hey

Hear me out
You must know (you must know)
What it's all about (baby)
That he's just a player in love (love)
This must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

[Chorus: x2][Chorus]
You're my shining star
That is what you are
There is no one like you baby
Angels everywhere
Every time you're near
You will always be my baby

Baby when you do the things you do
I want to be close to you
Cause I need to feel your every move, oh
Baby I can never say how much
I need your touch, I can't get enough
Cause you know what to do to turn me on, yeah

[Chorus]

Baby you're as close as close can get
And baby you know I'd let
Every single part of me be yours, ooh yeah
It doesn't matter if the phone might ring
Cause I won't hear a thing when I'm in your arms
Cause you know what to do to turn me on

[Chorus]

I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
Cause you are doing everything so right
Oh, oh baby
I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
Cause you are doing everything so right
Oh, oh baby

[Chorus]

You know that I adore you
want to be there everyday for you
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby
You know that I adore you
want to be there everyday for you
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby

[Chorus]It's in the silences, the words you never say
I see it in your eyes, always starts the same way
It seems like everyone we know is breaking up
Does anybody ever stay in love, anymore?

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

I see you look at me when you think I'm not aware
You're searching for clues of just how deep my feelings are
How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide?
All I know is what I feel when I look into your eyes

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything that I am

Oh, there are no guarantees
That's what you always say to me
But late at night I feel the tremble in your touch
But what I'm trying to say to you
I've never said to anyone

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

You're everything I am
With everything I am
You see me sitting here
A smile upon my face
The time has come but you know that it's not too late
There's been too many things
Together we have seen
It's not that hard if we start to believe
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

This world is not at ease
We seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only so much we can really do
It's up to you and me
To fix our destiny
The jury's here, so let's take the stand
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

So tell me why we have to cry (and not try)
When there's so many things we can do
To help this troubled world start anew

I need a reason, I need a sign
There's no turning back, I'm here by your side
Is it today or maybe tonight, we'll find
The answer to our life

Show me the way
Give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today, is it tonight
The answer to our life

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our lifeWe've been through days of thunder
Some people say we don't belong
They try to pull us under
But here we stand together in the new year strong

Let's get on with the show
(Let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are
And this one goes out to

[Chorus]
Everyone (yeah) , everyone, everyone
This one goes out to you,
Everyone
We're standing stronger 'cause' of what you've done
This one goes out to you

We've been inside the circus
We take the pleasure with the pain
I guess there's something about us
Whatever comes around will always stay the same
Oh yeah 

Let's get on with the show
(Oh let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are 
(we know who you are)

[Chorus]

Now we're minutes away
Till it's time to play
Our heartbeats are rising
They're letting you in
Time for the show to begin

Here
We're standing stronger from what you've done
This one goes out to you, you, you
You make us feel like we've just begun
And this one goes out to you... yeah

[Chorus: x2]I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
What's the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong
I heard him promise you forever
But forever's come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines, oh

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than that

Baby, you deserve much better
What's the use in holding on
Don't you see it's now or never
'Cause I just can't be friends
Baby knowing in the end, that

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

There's not a day that passes by
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
It's not too late to change your mind
So take my hand, don't say goodbye

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than that

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than thatI know that I
I can't believe
Just what the path has brought me
To the man I want to be
And I know that we
Have had some times
That we can't forget the struggle
Cause we have so far to go

I know we have changed
But change can be so good
So lets not forget why it's understood
That

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through
Time (time)
Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)
Time
(goes on and on) Goes on and on everyday
Baby time is what is, come what may

I remember when
Mom used to say
That things are getting better
And you'll soon be on your way
Remember those days
That we would sing at the drop of a dime
Way back when nothing else mattered

I know we have changed
But change can be so good
So lets not forget why it's understood
That

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through

Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)
Time

So here we are (here we are)
And we'll always stick together
And through it all you know we owe it all
To you (time goes on, it never stops, it keeps on)

I was looking for something
On the crime scene where you're in too deep
I found a note with his number
It's just another clue (that leads to you)

I got a little suspicious
I got a feeling that you ain't true to me
I should've known better
Than to buy your lie (your sweet disguise)

Yeah
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
that you're not for me babe

No no, uh uh
Things will never be the same again with you
No no, uh uh

That love should be
Let me tell you it's not for me

No no

I don't want to be part of your screenplay
Just tell me
Did you rehearse on me?
Now give me the story
On baby who's to blame (maybe I am)
Caught in the middle
And I'm tired of your games of hide and seek
I'm getting a feeling
That it's time for me to leave

You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
That you're not for me babe

From the bottom of my heart.

It's true.Remember when
Never needed each other
The best of friends
Like sister and brother
We understood
We'd never be alone

Those days are gone
Now I want you so much
The night is long
And I need your touch
Don't know what to say
Never meant to feel this way
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

I hear your voice
And I start to tremble
Brings back the child that
I resemble

I cannot pretend
That we can still be friends
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

I want to say this right
And it has to be tonight
Just need you to know

I don't want to live this life
I don't want to say goodbye
With you I want to spend
The rest of my life

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
Everything's changed
We never knew
How did I fall in love with youEmpty spaces fill me up with hopes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me I can't find no rest
Where I'm going is anybody's guess

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't want to make you face this world alone
I want to let you go

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

IncompleteLooking at your picture from when we first met
You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night

Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

All the doors are closing I'm tryin' to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day, the day you slipped away

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

That since I lost you, I lost myself
No I can't fake it, there's no one else

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to knowEverybody knows that I was such a fool to ever let go of you
And baby I was wrong
And yeah I know I said we'd be better off alone
It was time that we moved on
I know I broke your heart, I didn't mean to break your heart

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you.

I know you aren't there and you can make me wait, but I'm not gonna wait
It's the that least I could do, just to tell you face to face
I was lying to myself, now I'm dying in this hell
Girl I know you're mad
I can't blame you for being mad

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and now I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you

If you could see these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
Hear the heart that's barely beating, you would see a different man

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to youHey hey hey

The sun is over the city but it's an orange day
There is reason for lookin' up but I'm feelin' down
You see, I've got to catch a plane but won't buy a ticket
'Cause its' hard to just stop when you're spinnin' around

It's a weird world, don't you know it?
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world, no matter how you roll it

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love
It's a weird world, yeah

Sent a message to a G.I. in the desert
Said thank you man for bringin' another dawn
Back here it's her and me and we're havin' our first baby
He's out there takin' 'em on

It's a weird world and I know you know it
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world, no matter how you roll it

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love

I'm closin' my eyes but I'm startin' to see
While he's lookin' at you, she's lookin' at me
The only thing it does
Is just keep me away from you

Sure, part of this place would cheer if I die
But don't let them take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way for you to decide it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love

Hey hey heyWho are you now?
Are you still the same
Or did you change somehow?
What do you do
At this very moment when I think of you?
And when I'm looking back

Do you remember that?

No matter how I fight it
Can't deny it

Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

Now look at me
Instead of moving on, I refuse to see
That I keep coming back
And I'm stuck in a moment
That wasn't meant to last (to last)

I've tried to fight it
Can't deny it
You don't even know

That I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

No no

Just like you found me
Then I would never let you go (without you)

Just like you found me
Then I would never let you go (without you)

Though everything's been said and done (yeah)
I still feel you (I still feel you)
Like I'm right beside you (like I'm right beside you)
But still no (still no word) word from youYeah yeah yeah
Julie was a long way from home
She can make alone look pretty
Her attitude made a part of her landscape
Riding her bike through alphabet city

She likes to party in the backseat, under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise
She said "what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
She can lick her lips and smile and make you want to believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl
(Right now right now ooh ooh ooh)

Julie likes to shop lift in stores
Right alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stop
And make love on the floor until the camera made us

And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire
When she walked, I followed, when she laughed, I cried,
"What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
And I was wrapped around her finger, and I began to believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Tell me what you want from me
I've got everything you need
It's getting hard for me to breathe
Let me be your guarantee

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (a game)
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day (by day)
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl (poster girl)

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (just a game)
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Right now, right now
Right now, oh oh oh
Poster girl
Poster girl
Come on, come onOh, no

Take what you need 'cause I can't hold my breath
Say what you feel 'cause I've got nothing left, oh
I made a promise to myself last night
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

It wouldn't matter anyway, don't change a thing
You're perfect as you are, time has a way, time is all I've got
If my heart should shatter watching you
There'd be one less thing I'd have to prove

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

Heaven will be waiting when I fall into your lovely arms
I believe you'll find me there
You'll find me there

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'll take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

Wouldn't matter, anywayClose your eyes, make a wish
That this could last forever
If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now

Yeah, it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

Take my hand, take my life
Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain kept inside, yeah
There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now

Yeah, it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

It's an illusion
How can I feel this way if I can't have you?
It's an illusion
Nothing is real this way if I can't have you

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
(I don't wanna know)
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
(I'm climbing the walls)
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

I can't let you go, no

And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss, I miss youNo no baby 
How can I begin to tell you 
What you do to me every time I hear ya 
More willing to want to see ya 
I know that there's no use in 
Tryin' to explain the confusion 
But still I'm not complainin' 
'Bout my situation 
Let's not talk about a possible ending 

The very first time that I 
was lookin' to be your fella 
I found my inspiration 
hidin' in your expression 
So I put myself on forward 
for your consideration 

[Chorus]
Let's not talk about a possible ending 
Let's not think about it every day 
And I know I'm so in love with you 
I'm finding it harder and harder to breathe 
Every time I'm near a beautiful woman 

And so we put the top down 
To take you drivin' downtown 
I guess we'll know just what to do 
When you're lookin' to fool around 
It's too late to stop me 
I know we're gonna get down, get down, oh no 

[Chorus] 

My beautiful woman 
My beautiful woman 
Yes you are, yes you are 
My beautiful woman 
Anything that you want me to, I'll do 
My beautiful

be	 is for beautiful as the sunshine 
E tells me everything's feelin' alright 
A goes to you and me swingin' it down 
T is two, I want you 
You've got me actin' like a fool 

[Chorus: x2]

My beautiful woman 
My beautiful woman 
Yes you are, yes you are 
My beautiful woman 
You're so beautiful 
My beautiful woman 
My beautiful womanYeah, yeah 
It seems like yesterday when I said "I do" 
And after all this time my heart still burns for you 
If you don't know by now that you're my only one 
Take a look inside me and watch my heartstrings come undone 

I know I promised you forever 
Is there no stronger word I can use 
To reassure you when the storm is raging outside 
You're my safest place to hide 

Can you see me, here I am 
I need you like I needed you then 
When I feel like giving up 
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine 
You're my safest place to hide 

You see colors no one else can see 
In every breath you hear a symphony 
You understand me like nobody can 
I feel like my soul unfolding like a flower blooming 

When this whole world gets too crazy 
And there's nowhere left to go 
I know you give me sanctuary 
You're the only truth I know 
You're the road back home 

Can you see me, here I am 
Standing here where I've always been 
And when words are not enough 
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine 
You're my safest place to hide 
My safest place to hide 

I know I promised you forever 
There's no stronger word I can use 
To reassure when the storm is raging outside 
You're my safest place to hide 

Oh! Can you see me, here I am 
Standing here where I've always been 
When I feel like giving up 
I promise inside your heart I'd still find 
Yeah, yeah 
You're my safest place to hide, oh yeah 
You're my safest place to hideWhen you come back I won't be here
She said and gently pulled me near
If you want to talk you can call
I know it's not your fault

I just smiled and said let go of me
But there's something that I've just gotta know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said it's not my fault

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been

Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head

When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too
When the one that you want doesn't want you

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

Siberia, Siberia
When the one you want doesn't want you tooI really miss you
There's something that I gotta say

The things we did,
the things we said,
Keep coming back to me and make me smile again.
You showed me how to face the truth.
Everything that's good in me, I owe to you.

Though the distance that's between us now, may seem to be too far.
It will never separate us, deep inside I know you are

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)
Never Gone

No, no, no

I walk along these empty streets.
There is not a second you're not here with me.
The love you gave, the grace you've shown,
Will always give me strength and be my corner stone.
Some how you found a way to see the best I have in me.
As long as time goes on, I swear to you that you will be

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)

Never gone from me
If there's one thing I believe
I believe
I will see you somewhere down the road again.

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)
Never Gone

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)
Never GoneLast night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
Sunday afternoonWalking along the sky
Chasing a glimpse of you
Painting a world with stars I found inside your eyes
Up here above the haze
Everything looks so clear
Wondering what it would be like if you were here

And time takes time ([Howie:] takes time)
But I can't wait
To tell you how I feel

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

I hold you close when it all goes crazy
And through it all, you'll be my lady
Why, tell me why
You're everything
Everything but mine

You don't have to be afraid
Of somebody else's touch
Just gimme a chance to prove
Just how you should be loved

And time, it takes time ([Howie:] takes time)
It's not too late
To tell you how I feel

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

Everything but mine
Mine I know, oh baby
Someday you'll come around
I'm gonna leave the light on
And I won't let you down
No I won't let you down

I won't let you down

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

You're everything but mine
You're everything but mine
You're the sun, you're the star
You're the moon, you're the rain
Love your lips, love your eyes
Drivin' me insane, oh baby, baby
Everything but mine
You're everything but mineI close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I wanna let you walk away tonight without a word

I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling
Oh, if you were here right now,
I swear I'd tell you this

Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin it inside, it's killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

I climb the walls, yeah
I can see the edge,
But I can't take the fall, no
I've memorized the number
So why can't I make the call
Maybe 'cause I know you'll always be with me
In the possibility

Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin it inside, it's killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

No, no, no

I don't wanna be like this
I just wanna let you know
That everything I hold in
Is everything I can't let go (oh, can't let go)

'Cause

Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin it inside, it's killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

Don't you know it baby
I don't wanna waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'm inconsolable
Whoa yeah
I'm inconsolableHere we are, seven days
And seven nights of empty tries
It's ritual, habitual
But it's never gonna work this time

We're to the point of no return
And along the way the only thing we've learned
Is how to hurt each other

I'm looking back and wondering why
It took so long to realize
That nothing's changed, it never will
All these years of standing still
And still we stay in all this pain
And nothing's gonna make it go away

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know

So save your voice
Don't waste your breath
Can't you see we're at the end
And this goodbye is permanent
So wish me well and try to forget

And all the fights
And all the ways
We almost made it
But we never did
And it's finally come to this

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know

We can not hide what we've become
So sick and tired of being numb
It's done, it's done
It's done

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No, you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
'Cause I know, I know, I know
'Cause I know, 'cause I knowShe keeps her secrets
In her eyes
She wraps the truth
Inside her lies
Just when I can't say
What she's done to me
She comes to me
And leads me back to paradise

She's so hard to hold
But I can't let go

I'm a house of cards
In a hurricane
A reckless ride
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She tears away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles

Oh when she smiles

Maybe I'd fight if I could
It hurts so bad
But feels so good
She opens up just like
A rose to me
When she's close to me
Anything she'd ask me to
I would

It's out of control
But I can't let go

I'm a house of cards
In a hurricane
A reckless ride
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She tears away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles

When she looks at me
I get so weak

I'm a house of cards
In a hurricane
A reckless ride
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She tears away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles[Nick:]
There you go caught you crashin' my dreams again
Just when I'm trying to get over you
I tell my heart but I can't seem to comprehend
A day without you

[AJ:]
Now you've carved out a life
But I wear the scars
Reminding me by the hour
That it's time to accept that's the way the things are
I wish I could but

[Chorus:]
I can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why it can't be any other way
Any other way

[Brian:]
Since you drained all the color out of the sky
How am I supposed to feel?
It's like I'm livin' in somebody else's life
Tell me it's not real

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

[Howie:]
Like we never had a falling out
Like the tears had never hit the ground
Like you're still here
You're still here

[Brian:]
Since you drained all the color out of the sky

[Repeat Chorus 2x][AJ/Nick:]
She wakes up with the sun
She throws on her clothes
Hoping her car will start
The second time around
The day has begun
The line's out the door
Serving up fraps
Until she can't take anymore
I see it in her broken smile
Oh why

[Chorus:]
Wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way

[Howie/Nick:]
No she never looks my way
She never, never, ever looks my way
She ties up her hair
Her makeup is smeared
Wiping the tears that she wants no one to see
She screams on the pain
I hear every word
Why don't you know how beautiful you are
Just see it in my broken smile

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Brian/Howie:]
If I could be the light
To guide you through the darkness baby
If I could be the one
To change the ending to your story
I'd be one in a million
I'd be one in a million
Someday I will tell her
You're gonna work it out somedayStop it, stop it
Stop it, stop it
Go, stop and go
I just hit static
I used to read you
Loud and clear
Not like this
It's so erratic

And I'm not rational
When I see you around
Your inconsistency
And you know it's dragging me down
You're so conflicted baby

You're always walking away
One step and everything's over
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
I'm already dead
I already said (I already said) I'm sorry

Stop it
I've made mistakes
I've been an addict
A blind fanatic
Don't you know
You're not immune to the panic
With somebody

When the snow hits your skin
The cold don't last forever
But you're livin' again
If you don't let seasons change


How many times do I have to say it
Before you believe me

Stop it, stop it
Stop and go

Panic!I can see in your eyes
Broken windows, fallen skies
Baby, baby what you hidin' from
The light that followed you around
Lately nowhere to be found
Don't you know that I'm your place to run

You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know

That you can let go

Sifting through shattered dreams
Livin' in the in between
Baby, babe it's gonna be alright
(You can let go)
When you're lost, let down, disappointed
And jerked around in this cold, cold world
I will always be by your side

You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
There ain't nothin' you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know

That you can let go

Don't be afraid when you're falling apart
Don't hesitate I'll be right where you are
Open your eyes there's a crack in the dark

Never let me see you cry
You locked it somewhere deep inside
Baby, baby let me hold you tight

Make it alright

Baby, baby gonna be alright
Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you (I won't turn against you)
Not letting it show
Baby, babe gonna be alright
Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you
You can let go

You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
You can let go
There ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to knowHow come you never know
What you got until it's gone
Too bad
Because I never felt so good with anyone
How fooled was I into thinking
I was gonna be alright
Okay
Fine

So every day I try a little harder
To forget her
Lie here convince myself
Tomorrow will be better

The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of her memory
And now I know what it is
Love is what the trouble is
Love is what the trouble is

How come she said
You never wear your heart
Where I can see
Too bad
'Cause now I'm the one
Who's sorry
How stupid was I into thinking
I was gonna be alright
Okay
Fine
So everyday I find a little something
To remind me
No matter how I try
I can't put the past behind me

The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of her memory
And now I know what it is

Love has let me go
I'm alright, I'm okay
I'll be fine, give it time

But the only trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone (she's gone)
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of her memory (I just can't)
And now I know what it is (yes I do)
And now I know what it is
'Cause love is what the trouble is
The trouble
Love, love is what the trouble is[AJ:]
The first night that we met
I will never forget
Baby, you were a star
From that point in time
It was always you and I shining
So beautiful
When we're out with your friends
You treat me like I'm dead
It was like I'm invisible

[Nick:]
(I can't let it go)
That was unforgettable
(I can't let it go)
I just wanna let you know
(I can't let it go)
Situations unlivable
(I can't let it go)
I can't let it go
(I can't let it go)

[Chorus:]
Tell me what you say that you want me
All you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
Make me say oh no
I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right

[Brian:]
Oh, you got me twisted
Oh, you got me twisted
I'm not someone you can just disrespect
How would you feel if you were in my shoes
Feelin' used with your heart bruised

[Nick:]
(I can't let it go)
The situations critical
(I can't let it go)
Relationship is pitiful
(I can't let it go)
Everything's falling apart
(I can't let it go)
Cause you're so hypocritical

[Repeat Chorus]

[All:]
You're just no good for me
You're no good for me
You're just no good for me
I know you're no good for me

[Howie:]
You know
It's wrong to treat me cold
I've no one to hold
One day I'm gonna say goodbye
What's it gonna be
Girl I'm gonna leave
Unless you turn around
And treat me right

[Repeat Chorus]

[Howie:]
Just treat me right
Just treat me right

[Brian:]
Say that you want me

[Howie:]
Just treat me right
Just treat me right

[Repeat Chorus]I won't tell nobody
I'll just scream it in my mind
Nothing good in life is scripted
It's not like we predicted
That the one you want
Is gonna be the one you thought

I won't tell nobody
But I won't live like a prisoner
Nothing has to be so perfect
Can you tell me was it worth it
Because her heart can't lie
And even though her face may try
Love can keep you up all night

'Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side
Love will keep you up all night

If I don't tell a living soul
Still everyone would know
Yes they would
It's always three am somewhere
You know it when you get there

Some people try to cover it up
Some people think it's never enough (never enough)

'Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side
Love will keep you up all night

I don't mean to scare you
But everybody has a first time
One day when you're old and gray
Don't look back and never say
You should have tried
Stayed up all night

Love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide

One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone

Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side
To the other side
Love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're cryin', you're cryin'
Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side

Love will keep you up all night
Love will keep you up all night

Love will keep you up all night[Brian:]
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace
You could be anyone today
Maybe I would recognize you On a crowded street

[AJ:]
Maybe you'll take me by surprise
Will you be the one I had in mind

[Chorus (emphasis on AJ):]
There'll come a day
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Face to face
Like I'm imagining
Baby how can I be sure
That you're the one I'm waiting for
Will you be unmistakable

[AJ:]
Unmistakable

[Nick:]
People say we're watching our lives
Through a glass
Desperately waiting on a chance
I know you're out there
Holding on, holding out for me

[AJ:]
How are we to know the time is right
What if you're here and I'm just blind

[Repeat Chorus (emphasis on Nick)]

[Nick:]
How can I know a song I never heard
How will I know your voice
When you haven't said a word

[AJ:]
How do I know how this will end
Before we begin

[Nick:]
Before we begin

[Howie:]
There'll come a day
When you walk out of my dreams

[All:]
Face to face (face to face)
Like I'm imagining (Like I'm imagining)
Baby, how can I be sure (how can I be sure)
That you're the one I'm waiting for (You're the one I'm waiting for)
Will you be (will you be)
Will you be (will you be)

[AJ:]
Unmistakable
UnmistakableHow come I was the last to know
Took the stage then you stole the show
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
I was captured by that stare
Now I'm shattered, but I don't care
And the people walking by don't have a clue

That I kissed your face
'Til the sun was in our eyes
'Til the afternoon arrived
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

Monday is a funny thing
Still waiting for the phone to ring
Will my imagination take it slow
After Saturday, my life is changed
In a moment it was rearranged
Strange how easy it is letting go
And I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes
And now I'm running blind

And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

This sweet relief
Unexpected things
Is this the end or only the beginning

I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes
Like the afternoon
Now I'm running blind (running blind)
I can't explain (can't explain)

Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love that's made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoonI been walking around
Inside a haze
Between the lines of reason
Hiding from the ghost
Of yesterday
Feels like I'm barely breathing

I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

I've been losin days
The shades pulled down
I still can't face the sun

But I-I'm goin crazy
I can't stay here
I've gone completely numb
I just wanna need someone
I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

Oh no
I thought you were the only one girl
But now I think I was wrong
Cause life goes on
Na na na na na

I've been walking around inside a haze

Oh I,

I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

In a downpour feel the rain
Feel the rain

I wanna feel the rainSo I lay awake another hour
Just like the one before
The shadows play a game with my head
I can't take this anymore

I hear the sound
Of my own breathing
It makes me miss you more

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Just leave me here in pieces
In pieces

I can't take the chance
Of running into
You running into me
So lock the door
And close the window
I just wanna see

Until the day
Inside my future
When I'll be on my feet

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Just leave me here in pieces
In pieces

If you want you can find me
On the dark side of the sun
Babe I don't wanna see what we've become
The damage has all been done

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
Wake me up when it's over
When the damage has all been done
The damage is done
I don't wanna be somewhere
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Leave me here in pieces
Just leave me in pieces
Just leave me in pieces
Just wake me up when it's over (in pieces)
Just wake me up when it's overLooking for beauty in a certain 
Finding the strength inside a gray 
Maybe I'm heading for a breakdown 
And maybe that's ok 
Could be I'm hanging on for dear life 
Maybe I need to get a grip 
Cause you're the only one 
That makes me feel like this 
So

[Chorus]
Save me I'm falling again 
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces 
In the end no matter what I do 
There's nowhere, nowhere to go 

Nowhere to go but you

Tryin' to make nothing out of something 
Promise myself I wouldn't care 
Maybe you're making me a liar cause I'm sitting here 
You finally crackin' my resistance 
And find a way to wear me down 

Yea, I just look at you 
And there's no way out 


Every single road I take (it's you) 
Asleep or wide awake (I know it's you) 
And it's too late for anyone to save me 

I'm falling again 
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces 

[Chorus: x2]

And everything I do
I want to be with you

Yeah everybody say
Yeah, see you once again

So that I can see

What's missin' in me
I'm looking for a sign
In the things you do
I want to be with you
And I'll be waitin'
Until you face the truth
When the light is fadin'
You know what I want to do

I want to be with you
It's crazy but it's true
And everything I do
I want to be with youListen girl, I don't know where to start 
'Cause every word I say is straight from the heart 
I've been so wrong, I've never meant to hurt you 
Oh girl, I'm sorry of what I put you through 
Girl I'd do anything for one more chance
'Cause I want you back again 

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I see 

You and I we shared enough together 
Each other was all we'd ever need 
I thought that you would stay with me forever 
But I took for granted the love you gave to me 
But I'll keep on trying, till the end 
Baby I need you back with me 
I need you back

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I see 

And girl I'm going out of my mind 
I miss ya so much, I don't know what to do 
Please say its just a matter of time, 
Until I feel your touch, 
Until you let me come back to you 

I think about you girl every time at night 
I'm in love, and it feels so right 
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain 
I was just caught up in the lying game 
But now those days are over, I've changed my ways 
Now I'm counting the minutes, I'm counting the days 
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start 
To find a new way to get back into your heart 

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I seeBaby, can I talk to you?
I know something's wrong
Things just ain't the same
But deep down inside
I know you still care
So tell me what to do
To get things back
The way they used to be

If your words had meaning
If you really cared about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart
If you were my lover
A constant friend to me
Tell me why
Would you turn away from my love

Tell me what to do to make things right for love (for love)

If your words have reason
When they won't turn away from me
They're trying hard to hide all truth they might say
If you listen to me girl
If you know how I'm feeling inside
Then maybe you wouldn't shut me out your life, baby

I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't know)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (yeah)
As long as you love me
As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did (yeah)
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love meI don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know
But if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine!

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

To you, hey girl
Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
I Love You

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you
My love is all I have to give

My love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you

I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you[Chorus]
Oh baby I'm missing you 
We used the love so strong 
Tell me where do we go 
Oh baby I'm missing you 
They said I'd learn to forget but it sure ain't happen yet 

Been checkin' out the places where we used to go 
Been lookin' for your face inside the crowd 
I've been talkin' to the people what we used to know 
Nobody wants to say where you hang out

And when I call your phone 
Seems like you're never home 
And you don't return my call 
It tears me apart 
This is breakin' up my heart 

[Chorus]

I still have your pictures hung around my room 
That's the only thing that is left of you with me 
Girl what can I do to make you come back soon
And make it just the way it used to be

Oh, this is someone new 
Can never go on without you 
Girl I don't want to think about it 
I can't sleep at night 
No this can't be right 
Come back into my life 
(Come back baby come back) 

[Chorus]

I know there's a chance for you and I 
And I believe there's no way our love could die 
So no matter how long it takes I'll wait for you 
And what ever it takes I'll be there for you 
I'll be there, I'll be there 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]Hey, yeah
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
That's the way I like it
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)

Somebody told me that you're not my kind
So have I lost my mind? (That's the way I like it)
You keep on doing all the things I like
You've got me hypnotized
But that's the way I like it

Girl you make me wanna move
It's the price I got to pay
For all the things you do
But I like it
You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

Oh, mystery lady, you've got somethin' I like
Tell me you're here to stay (ooh yeah)
You're dangerous, oh baby
Could you do me right?
Will you come out to play?
'Cause that's the way I like it

Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)

Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on

You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
Hey, yeah!

That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it (everybody now)
That is the way I like it (everybody now)
That's the way that I like it (everybody come on)
That is the way I like it (everybody come on)
That's the way I like it

That is the way I like it

(That's the way that, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)
(That's the way)Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh, what a life
Once we were dreamers just dreamers we were
Oh, you and I
Now I see you're just somebody who wastes all my time and money
What a lie, you and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

Once I could handle the truth
When the truth was you and I
But time after time all the
Promises turned out to be all lies
Now I see I'm just somebody who wasted my time and money
What a lie (what a lie, what a lie, oh)
You and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

You said "I'll take you back"
But I closed the door 'cause I don't want
10,000 more
Oh

10,000 promises yeah (oh)
10,000 promises you gave to me

Repeat chorus
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me (That you gave to me)
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me
Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh you and I
What a lieIf I could right the wrongs that made you cry 
I make a promise not to say good-night
"Cause I'm holding on 
With a love so strong
And I can't take a day without you by my side

Girl if i could change
If I could change your mind
Baby you could  help me wipe these tears from my eyes

[Chorus]
Girl don't stop
The sun from shining down on me 
'Cause  I can't face another day without your smile
And if you take away the love and arms that surround me 
The I might break down and cry just like a child

Girl,I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me
So I'm pressin' on
I hope you understand
There's a broken heart that lies inside your hands

So if I could change 
And it won't hurt your pride
Baby you could help me stop these tears that I cry

[Chorus]

Like a child 
Just like a child
With the spirits running free 
She showed my why
Oh, she did

Like a child(oh baby)
Just like a child
Think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
Like a child

[Chorus]do, da da da da
do, da da da da
do, da da da da

The candle plays the hourglass
Days go and all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
Every smile even all the reasons why
You say I pushed you out of my life

Chorus
Baby you set me (ha-ha-ahhh)
Baby you set me (do da da da da)
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you set me 
Set adrift on memory bliss

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with 
The biggest empty void 
I've ever had in life (ever had in life)
Bet you say that I don't care
Bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there 
when the mornin comes
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life)
Baby will you be there
When I open my eyes
After all the time I've spent 
Wishing you

Chorus

Sadness has overwhelmed me
my mind flies carelessly 
I Imagine that you're happy 
With your life right now
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things
That I could never have

Chorus to fade
The candle plays the hourglass
The days go and all I do is
Think of you and wonder where you are at night
Oh I remember everything
Every smile, and even all
The reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my life

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life (ever had in life) ohh
Bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there when the morning comes?
(Baby will you be there?)
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life, baby)
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes?
After all the time I've spent, wishing you

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind flies and carelessly
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now oh
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things that I can never have

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

So come on now
I know this much is true
I know this much is trueThere are people who say what you want to hear 
Even on a rainy day they'll tell you the sky is clear 
When you really, really love someone 
And I'm right when I say that you want them near 
And if you can't even tell 
Them things that they want to hear 

[Chorus]
Always forever, all the things she said 
Never say never, those simple lies that she fed 
I will never leave you 
All the love I thought she had 
But can you blame me, no, 
'Cause that's what she said 
That's what she said 
She told me we'd see forever 
That's what she said, she said, yeah 

And,
There are people who that say what they really mean 
She said she'd always be there 
She said she'd always care 
But just when you think that you can trust that someone ya love 
Tell me why do you know 
How stars can fall from above 

[Chorus]

'Cause you made promises that you couldn't keep 
But you're not hurting' yourself 
But you're only hurting me (you're only hurting me) 
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean 
Oh how can I make you see just-a what you did to me 

Oh, you said how much you really cared 
Just when I thought I was in love 
Girl, how could you dare 
If I were you I wouldn't lie not even-a once 
To the face of the one that I love so much 

[Chorus]

Oh that's what she saidIf you want it to be good girl

Girl  I wake up and pray
That you'll come back home
Don't take too long
Cause since you've been gone
Everything's gone  all went wrong
I wish you were here
holding me near

You know I'd go
out of my mind
If you ever left
my heart behind
So I'm begging you please
Bring your sweet love back to me

If I don't have you
(Don't have you)
to hold on to

If I don't have you
If you say goodbye
(you said goodbye)
Girl, I would die
(Girl, I would die)
I'm a star with no light
a day with no night
If I don't have youI may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

All of your time spent keeps us alive

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger
That makes you larger
That makes you larger than lifeYeah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way

Am I, your fire?

Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake

Now I can see that we've fallen apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

You are my fire
The one desire
You are (you are, you are, you are)

'Cause I want it that wayShow me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze upon me
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be
You're asking me
To feel the things you never show

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are (where you are)

You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture
On the Backstreet's Back, alright
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed baby
But I should have known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with
Don't, don't want you back

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I, I don't want you back

You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go

That I could control this
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you, baby
Girl if only I knew what I've done
You know, so why don't you tell me
And I, I would bring down the moon and the sun
To show how much I care

Don't want to lose you now
Baby, I know we can win this
Don't want to lose you now
No no, or ever again

I've got this feeling you're not gonna stay
It's burning within me
The fear of losing
Of slipping away
It just keeps getting closer, baby
Whatever reason to leave that I've had
My place was always beside you
And I wish that I didn't need you so bad
Your face just won't go away

And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong and love is right
For us tonight

When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

Let it be (let it be) if we're nothing more than dreamers
Who believe (who believe) that we see no wall between us
How can they be in my heart (in my heart) and in my mind (in my mind)
When all I could find

When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

I loved you from a distance
Thought I couldn't reach that far
I can't believe how close that we are (believe how close we are, ooh ooh)
When I look into your Spanish eyes
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes (ooh yeah)When we turn out the lights
The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
But girl you know that I would never
Ever let another's touch
Come between the two of us

'Cause no one else will ever take your place

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder
You're my dream come true, oh yeah
Girl you know I'll always treasure
Every kiss and everyday 
I'll love you girl in every way
And I always will, 'cause in my eyes

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much

(Girl can't you see that) No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally, babe
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

No one else comes close
Oh girl, oh oh
No one else comes closeIt takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I want to thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
Be the perfect son

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know

Just how to walk without your hands

You showed me how to love (you showed me how to love)
You showed me how to care (you showed me how to care)
You showed me that you would
Always be there
I want to thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine

I love you mom"Hello"
"Hi, it's me, what's up, baby?
I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight
So don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"Say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really dropping out
I think my battery must be low
Listen, if you can hear me
We're going to a place nearby, alright?
Gotta go!"

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should've said, "No, someone's waiting for me"
But I called my girl up and said

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Listen, baby, I'm sorry (hello?)
Listen, baby, I'm sorry (hello?)
Gotta go

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
Gotta go

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"Yeah, yeah

Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become, oh yeah

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful, loneliness that's tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (trying)
I played my part, kept you in the dark (in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark (keep you in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (trying to be someone)
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart (now let me show you the shape of my heart)

Show you the shape of my heartBackstreet
Check it uh
Hey

Let's talk about one, baby
You gotta hear me out
Did you really think I'd be the last to know
What it's all about

Let's talk about you
You say 
He's the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't want to know

I'm tellin' you he'll eat you up from inside
And then he doesn't want to know

[Chorus]
Listen I mean it
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another player
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

Let's talk about what he's done (he's done)
To become your number one
Or was it all the promises of diamonds, pearls and party dresses
That turn you on
I've seen it before (dont take!)
Anymore, free too
You're through for sure
Just go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up
I'm tellin' you to go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up

Listen I mean it (I mean it)
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another player (player)
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end (must come to an end)
Get another boyfriend

All right 
Yeah
Get another boyfriend
Stop
Hey

Hear me out
You must know (you must know)
What it's all about (baby)
That he's just a player in love (love)
This must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

[Chorus: x2][Chorus]
You're my shining star
That is what you are
There is no one like you baby
Angels everywhere
Every time you're near
You will always be my baby

Baby when you do the things you do
I want to be close to you
Cause I need to feel your every move, oh
Baby I can never say how much
I need your touch, I can't get enough
Cause you know what to do to turn me on, yeah

[Chorus]

Baby you're as close as close can get
And baby you know I'd let
Every single part of me be yours, ooh yeah
It doesn't matter if the phone might ring
Cause I won't hear a thing when I'm in your arms
Cause you know what to do to turn me on

[Chorus]

I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
Cause you are doing everything so right
Oh, oh baby
I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
Cause you are doing everything so right
Oh, oh baby

[Chorus]

You know that I adore you
want to be there everyday for you
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby
You know that I adore you
want to be there everyday for you
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby

[Chorus]It's in the silences, the words you never say
I see it in your eyes, always starts the same way
It seems like everyone we know is breaking up
Does anybody ever stay in love, anymore?

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

I see you look at me when you think I'm not aware
You're searching for clues of just how deep my feelings are
How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide?
All I know is what I feel when I look into your eyes

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything that I am

Oh, there are no guarantees
That's what you always say to me
But late at night I feel the tremble in your touch
But what I'm trying to say to you
I've never said to anyone

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

You're everything I am
With everything I am
You see me sitting here
A smile upon my face
The time has come but you know that it's not too late
There's been too many things
Together we have seen
It's not that hard if we start to believe
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

This world is not at ease
We seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only so much we can really do
It's up to you and me
To fix our destiny
The jury's here, so let's take the stand
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

So tell me why we have to cry (and not try)
When there's so many things we can do
To help this troubled world start anew

I need a reason, I need a sign
There's no turning back, I'm here by your side
Is it today or maybe tonight, we'll find
The answer to our life

Show me the way
Give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today, is it tonight
The answer to our life

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our lifeWe've been through days of thunder
Some people say we don't belong
They try to pull us under
But here we stand together in the new year strong

Let's get on with the show
(Let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are
And this one goes out to

[Chorus]
Everyone (yeah) , everyone, everyone
This one goes out to you,
Everyone
We're standing stronger 'cause' of what you've done
This one goes out to you

We've been inside the circus
We take the pleasure with the pain
I guess there's something about us
Whatever comes around will always stay the same
Oh yeah 

Let's get on with the show
(Oh let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are 
(we know who you are)

[Chorus]

Now we're minutes away
Till it's time to play
Our heartbeats are rising
They're letting you in
Time for the show to begin

Here
We're standing stronger from what you've done
This one goes out to you, you, you
You make us feel like we've just begun
And this one goes out to you... yeah

[Chorus: x2]I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
What's the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong
I heard him promise you forever
But forever's come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines, oh

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than that

Baby, you deserve much better
What's the use in holding on
Don't you see it's now or never
'Cause I just can't be friends
Baby knowing in the end, that

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

There's not a day that passes by
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
It's not too late to change your mind
So take my hand, don't say goodbye

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than that

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than thatI know that I
I can't believe
Just what the path has brought me
To the man I want to be
And I know that we
Have had some times
That we can't forget the struggle
Cause we have so far to go

I know we have changed
But change can be so good
So lets not forget why it's understood
That

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through
Time (time)
Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)
Time
(goes on and on) Goes on and on everyday
Baby time is what is, come what may

I remember when
Mom used to say
That things are getting better
And you'll soon be on your way
Remember those days
That we would sing at the drop of a dime
Way back when nothing else mattered

I know we have changed
But change can be so good
So lets not forget why it's understood
That

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through
Time (time)
Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)
Time
(goes on and on) Goes on and on everyday

So here we are (here we are)
And we'll always stick together
And through it all you know we owe it all
To you (time goes on, it never stops, it keeps on)

Yeah yeah

I was looking for something
On the crime scene where you're in too deep
I found a note with his number
It's just another clue (that leads to you)

I got a little suspicious
I got a feeling that you ain't true to me
I should've known better
Than to buy your lie (your sweet disguise)

Yeah
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
that you're not for me babe

No no, uh uh
Things will never be the same again with you
No no, uh uh
Now I know what it's comin' to
No no, uh uh
'cause' if you think that it's the way
That love should be
Let me tell you it's not for me

No no

I don't want to be part of your screenplay
Just tell me
Did you rehearse on me?
Now give me the story
On baby who's to blame (maybe I am)
Caught in the middle
And I'm tired of your games of hide and seek
I'm getting a feeling
That it's time for me to leave

You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
That you're not for me babe

No no, uh uh
Things will never be the same again with you
No no, uh uh
Now I know what it's comin' to
No no, uh uh
'cause' if you think that it's the way
That love should be
Let me tell you it's not for me

Yeah (yeah)
I said no no (no way)
No no, no no (whoa)

I had enough of your talk, your games
And you won't go away
Justify my reasons to say
(Say, reasons to say)

No no, uh uh
Things will never be the same again with you
No no, uh uh
Now I know what it's comin' to
No no, uh uh

The way you make me feel inside
You complete me

And I'm sorry for the things I did,
For your teardrops, or the words I said.
Can you forgive me and open your heart once again?  Oh yeah.

It's true.  I mean it.
From the bottom of my heart.
Yeah, it's true.
Without you I would fall apart.

Whatever happened, I know that I was wrong. Oh yes.

But I love you and I always will,
So I wonder if you want me still.
Can you forgive me and open your heart once again?
Oh yeah.

From the bottom of my heart.
Yeah, it's true.
Without you I would fall apart.

It's true.Remember when
Never needed each other
The best of friends
Like sister and brother
We understood
We'd never be alone

Those days are gone
Now I want you so much
The night is long
And I need your touch
Don't know what to say
Never meant to feel this way
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

I hear your voice
And I start to tremble
Brings back the child that
I resemble

I cannot pretend
That we can still be friends
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

I want to say this right
And it has to be tonight
Just need you to know

I don't want to live this life
I don't want to say goodbye
With you I want to spend
The rest of my life

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
Everything's changed
We never knew
How did I fall in love with youEmpty spaces fill me up with hopes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me I can't find no rest
Where I'm going is anybody's guess

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't want to make you face this world alone
I want to let you go

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

IncompleteLooking at your picture from when we first met
You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night

Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

All the doors are closing I'm tryin' to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day, the day you slipped away

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

That since I lost you, I lost myself
No I can't fake it, there's no one else

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to knowEverybody knows that I was such a fool to ever let go of you
And baby I was wrong
And yeah I know I said we'd be better off alone
It was time that we moved on
I know I broke your heart, I didn't mean to break your heart

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you.

I know you aren't there and you can make me wait, but I'm not gonna wait
It's the that least I could do, just to tell you face to face
I was lying to myself, now I'm dying in this hell
Girl I know you're mad
I can't blame you for being mad

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and now I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you

If you could see these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
Hear the heart that's barely beating, you would see a different man

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to youHey hey hey

The sun is over the city but it's an orange day
There is reason for lookin' up but I'm feelin' down
You see, I've got to catch a plane but won't buy a ticket
'Cause its' hard to just stop when you're spinnin' around

It's a weird world, don't you know it?
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world, no matter how you roll it

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love
It's a weird world, yeah

Sent a message to a G.I. in the desert
Said thank you man for bringin' another dawn
Back here it's her and me and we're havin' our first baby
He's out there takin' 'em on

It's a weird world and I know you know it
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world, no matter how you roll it

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love

I'm closin' my eyes but I'm startin' to see
While he's lookin' at you, she's lookin' at me
The only thing it does
Is just keep me away from you

Sure, part of this place would cheer if I die
But don't let them take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way for you to decide it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love

Hey hey hey

Hey hey hey
(Oh, it's a weird world, don't you know it?)
Hey hey heyWho are you now?
Are you still the same
Or did you change somehow?
What do you do
At this very moment when I think of you?
And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
Do you remember that?

No matter how I fight it
Can't deny it
Just can't let you go

I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

Now look at me
Instead of moving on, I refuse to see
That I keep coming back
And I'm stuck in a moment
That wasn't meant to last (to last)

I've tried to fight it
Can't deny it
You don't even know

That I still need you
I still care about you

Julie was a long way from home
She can make alone look pretty
Her attitude made a part of her landscape
Riding her bike through alphabet city

She likes to party in the backseat, under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise
She said "what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
She can lick her lips and smile and make you want to believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl
(Right now right now ooh ooh ooh)

Julie likes to shop lift in stores
Right alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stop
And make love on the floor until the camera made us

And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire
When she walked, I followed, when she laughed, I cried,
"What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
And I was wrapped around her finger, and I began to believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Tell me what you want from me
I've got everything you need
It's getting hard for me to breathe
Let me be your guarantee

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (a game)

She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl (poster girl)

Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Right now, right now
Right now, oh oh oh
Poster girl
Poster girl
Come on, come onOh, no

Take what you need 'cause I can't hold my breath
Say what you feel 'cause I've got nothing left, oh
I made a promise to myself last night
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

It wouldn't matter anyway, don't change a thing
You're perfect as you are, time has a way, time is all I've got
If my heart should shatter watching you
There'd be one less thing I'd have to prove

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

Heaven will be waiting when I fall into your lovely arms
I believe you'll find me there
You'll find me there

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'll take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

Wouldn't matter, anywayClose your eyes, make a wish
That this could last forever
If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now

Yeah, it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

Take my hand, take my life
Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain kept inside, yeah
There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now

Yeah, it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

It's an illusion
How can I feel this way if I can't have you?
It's an illusion
Nothing is real this way if I can't have you

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
(I don't wanna know)
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
(I'm climbing the walls)
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

I can't let you go, no

And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss, I miss youNo no baby 
How can I begin to tell you 
What you do to me every time I hear ya 
More willing to want to see ya 
I know that there's no use in 
Tryin' to explain the confusion 
But still I'm not complainin' 
'Bout my situation 
Let's not talk about a possible ending 

The very first time that I 
was lookin' to be your fella 
I found my inspiration 
hidin' in your expression 
So I put myself on forward 
for your consideration 

[Chorus]
Let's not talk about a possible ending 
Let's not think about it every day 
And I know I'm so in love with you 
I'm finding it harder and harder to breathe 
Every time I'm near a beautiful woman 

And so we put the top down 
To take you drivin' downtown 
I guess we'll know just what to do 
When you're lookin' to fool around 
It's too late to stop me 
I know we're gonna get down, get down, oh no 

[Chorus] 

My beautiful woman 
My beautiful woman 
Yes you are, yes you are 
My beautiful woman 
Anything that you want me to, I'll do 
My beautiful

be	 is for beautiful as the sunshine 
E tells me everything's feelin' alright 
A goes to you and me swingin' it down 
T is two, I want you 
You've got me actin' like a fool 

[Chorus: x2]

My beautiful woman 
My beautiful woman 
Yes you are, yes you are 
My beautiful woman 
You're so beautiful 
My beautiful woman 
My beautiful womanYeah, yeah 
It seems like yesterday when I said "I do" 
And after all this time my heart still burns for you 
If you don't know by now that you're my only one 
Take a look inside me and watch my heartstrings come undone 

I know I promised you forever 
Is there no stronger word I can use 
To reassure you when the storm is raging outside 
You're my safest place to hide 

Can you see me, here I am 
I need you like I needed you then 
When I feel like giving up 
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine 
You're my safest place to hide 

You see colors no one else can see 
In every breath you hear a symphony 
You understand me like nobody can 
I feel like my soul unfolding like a flower blooming 

When this whole world gets too crazy 
And there's nowhere left to go 
I know you give me sanctuary 
You're the only truth I know 
You're the road back home 

Can you see me, here I am 
Standing here where I've always been 
And when words are not enough 
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine 
You're my safest place to hide 
My safest place to hide 

I know I promised you forever 
There's no stronger word I can use 
To reassure when the storm is raging outside 
You're my safest place to hide 

Oh! Can you see me, here I am 
Standing here where I've always been 
When I feel like giving up 
I promise inside your heart I'd still find 
Yeah, yeah 
You're my safest place to hide, oh yeah 
You're my safest place to hideWhen you come back I won't be here
She said and gently pulled me near
If you want to talk you can call
I know it's not your fault

I just smiled and said let go of me
But there's something that I've just gotta know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said it's not my fault

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been

Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head

When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too
When the one that you want doesn't want you

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

Siberia, Siberia
When the one you want doesn't want you tooI really miss you
There's something that I gotta say

The things we did,
the things we said,
Keep coming back to me and make me smile again.
You showed me how to face the truth.
Everything that's good in me, I owe to you.

Though the distance that's between us now, may seem to be too far.
It will never separate us, deep inside I know you are

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)
Never Gone

No, no, no

I walk along these empty streets.
There is not a second you're not here with me.
The love you gave, the grace you've shown,
Will always give me strength and be my corner stone.
Some how you found a way to see the best I have in me.
As long as time goes on, I swear to you that you will be

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)

Never gone from me
If there's one thing I believe
I believe
I will see you somewhere down the road again.

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)
Never Gone

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)
Never GoneLast night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
Sunday afternoonWalking along the sky
Chasing a glimpse of you
Painting a world with stars I found inside your eyes
Up here above the haze
Everything looks so clear
Wondering what it would be like if you were here

And time takes time ([Howie:] takes time)
But I can't wait
To tell you how I feel

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

I hold you close when it all goes crazy
And through it all, you'll be my lady
Why, tell me why
You're everything
Everything but mine

You don't have to be afraid
Of somebody else's touch
Just gimme a chance to prove
Just how you should be loved

And time, it takes time ([Howie:] takes time)
It's not too late
To tell you how I feel

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

Everything but mine
Mine I know, oh baby
Someday you'll come around
I'm gonna leave the light on
And I won't let you down
No I won't let you down

I won't let you down

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

You're everything but mine
You're everything but mine
You're the sun, you're the star
You're the moon, you're the rain
Love your lips, love your eyes
Drivin' me insane, oh baby, baby
Everything but mine
You're everything but mineI close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I wanna let you walk away tonight without a word

I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling
Oh, if you were here right now,
I swear I'd tell you this

Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin it inside, it's killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

I climb the walls, yeah
I can see the edge,
But I can't take the fall, no
I've memorized the number
So why can't I make the call
Maybe 'cause I know you'll always be with me
In the possibility

Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin it inside, it's killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

No, no, no

I don't wanna be like this
I just wanna let you know
That everything I hold in
Is everything I can't let go (oh, can't let go)

'Cause

Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin it inside, it's killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

Don't you know it baby
I don't wanna waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'm inconsolable
Whoa yeah
I'm inconsolableHere we are, seven days
And seven nights of empty tries
It's ritual, habitual
But it's never gonna work this time

We're to the point of no return
And along the way the only thing we've learned
Is how to hurt each other

I'm looking back and wondering why
It took so long to realize
That nothing's changed, it never will
All these years of standing still
And still we stay in all this pain
And nothing's gonna make it go away

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know

So save your voice
Don't waste your breath
Can't you see we're at the end
And this goodbye is permanent
So wish me well and try to forget

And all the fights
And all the ways
We almost made it
But we never did
And it's finally come to this

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know

We can not hide what we've become
So sick and tired of being numb
It's done, it's done
It's done

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No, you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
'Cause I know, I know, I know
'Cause I know, 'cause I knowShe keeps her secrets
In her eyes
She wraps the truth
Inside her lies
Just when I can't say
What she's done to me
She comes to me
And leads me back to paradise

She's so hard to hold
But I can't let go

I'm a house of cards
In a hurricane
A reckless ride
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She tears away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles

Oh when she smiles

Maybe I'd fight if I could
It hurts so bad
But feels so good
She opens up just like
A rose to me
When she's close to me
Anything she'd ask me to
I would

It's out of control
But I can't let go

I'm a house of cards
In a hurricane
A reckless ride
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She tears away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles

When she looks at me
I get so weak

I'm a house of cards
In a hurricane
A reckless ride
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She tears away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles[Nick:]
There you go caught you crashin' my dreams again
Just when I'm trying to get over you
I tell my heart but I can't seem to comprehend
A day without you

[AJ:]
Now you've carved out a life
But I wear the scars
Reminding me by the hour
That it's time to accept that's the way the things are
I wish I could but

[Chorus:]
I can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why it can't be any other way
Any other way

[Brian:]
Since you drained all the color out of the sky
How am I supposed to feel?
It's like I'm livin' in somebody else's life
Tell me it's not real

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

[Howie:]
Like we never had a falling out
Like the tears had never hit the ground
Like you're still here
You're still here

[Brian:]
Since you drained all the color out of the sky

[Repeat Chorus 2x][AJ/Nick:]
She wakes up with the sun
She throws on her clothes
Hoping her car will start
The second time around
The day has begun
The line's out the door
Serving up fraps
Until she can't take anymore
I see it in her broken smile
Oh why

[Chorus:]
Wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way

[Howie/Nick:]
No she never looks my way
She never, never, ever looks my way
She ties up her hair
Her makeup is smeared
Wiping the tears that she wants no one to see
She screams on the pain
I hear every word
Why don't you know how beautiful you are
Just see it in my broken smile

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Brian/Howie:]
If I could be the light
To guide you through the darkness baby
If I could be the one
To change the ending to your story
I'd be one in a million
I'd be one in a million
Someday I will tell her
You're gonna work it out somedayStop it, stop it
Stop it, stop it
Go, stop and go
I just hit static
I used to read you
Loud and clear
Not like this
It's so erratic

And I'm not rational
When I see you around
Your inconsistency
And you know it's dragging me down
You're so conflicted baby

You're always walking away
One step and everything's over
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
I'm already dead
I already said (I already said) I'm sorry

Stop it
I've made mistakes
I've been an addict
A blind fanatic
Don't you know
You're not immune to the panic
With somebody

When the snow hits your skin
The cold don't last forever
But you're livin' again
If you don't let seasons change


How many times do I have to say it
Before you believe me

Stop it, stop it
Stop and go

Panic!I can see in your eyes
Broken windows, fallen skies
Baby, baby what you hidin' from
The light that followed you around
Lately nowhere to be found
Don't you know that I'm your place to run

You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know

That you can let go

Sifting through shattered dreams
Livin' in the in between
Baby, babe it's gonna be alright
(You can let go)
When you're lost, let down, disappointed
And jerked around in this cold, cold world
I will always be by your side

You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
There ain't nothin' you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know

That you can let go

Don't be afraid when you're falling apart
Don't hesitate I'll be right where you are
Open your eyes there's a crack in the dark

Never let me see you cry
You locked it somewhere deep inside
Baby, baby let me hold you tight

Make it alright

Baby, baby gonna be alright
Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you (I won't turn against you)
Not letting it show
Baby, babe gonna be alright
Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you
You can let go

You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
You can let go
There ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to knowHow come you never know
What you got until it's gone
Too bad
Because I never felt so good with anyone
How fooled was I into thinking
I was gonna be alright
Okay
Fine

So every day I try a little harder
To forget her
Lie here convince myself
Tomorrow will be better

The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of her memory
And now I know what it is
Love is what the trouble is
Love is what the trouble is

How come she said
You never wear your heart
Where I can see
Too bad
'Cause now I'm the one
Who's sorry
How stupid was I into thinking
I was gonna be alright
Okay
Fine
So everyday I find a little something
To remind me
No matter how I try
I can't put the past behind me

The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of her memory
And now I know what it is

Love has let me go
I'm alright, I'm okay
I'll be fine, give it time

But the only trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone (she's gone)
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of her memory (I just can't)
And now I know what it is (yes I do)
And now I know what it is
'Cause love is what the trouble is
The trouble
Love, love is what the trouble is[AJ:]
The first night that we met
I will never forget
Baby, you were a star
From that point in time
It was always you and I shining
So beautiful
When we're out with your friends
You treat me like I'm dead
It was like I'm invisible

[Nick:]
(I can't let it go)
That was unforgettable
(I can't let it go)
I just wanna let you know
(I can't let it go)
Situations unlivable
(I can't let it go)
I can't let it go
(I can't let it go)

[Chorus:]
Tell me what you say that you want me
All you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
Make me say oh no
I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right

[Brian:]
Oh, you got me twisted
Oh, you got me twisted
I'm not someone you can just disrespect
How would you feel if you were in my shoes
Feelin' used with your heart bruised

[Nick:]
(I can't let it go)
The situations critical
(I can't let it go)
Relationship is pitiful
(I can't let it go)
Everything's falling apart
(I can't let it go)
Cause you're so hypocritical

[Repeat Chorus]

[All:]
You're just no good for me
You're no good for me
You're just no good for me
I know you're no good for me

[Howie:]
You know
It's wrong to treat me cold
I've no one to hold
One day I'm gonna say goodbye
What's it gonna be
Girl I'm gonna leave
Unless you turn around
And treat me right

[Repeat Chorus]

[Howie:]
Just treat me right
Just treat me right

[Brian:]
Say that you want me

[Howie:]
Just treat me right
Just treat me right

[Repeat Chorus]I won't tell nobody
I'll just scream it in my mind
Nothing good in life is scripted
It's not like we predicted
That the one you want
Is gonna be the one you thought

I won't tell nobody
But I won't live like a prisoner
Nothing has to be so perfect
Can you tell me was it worth it
Because her heart can't lie
And even though her face may try
Love can keep you up all night

'Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side
Love will keep you up all night

If I don't tell a living soul
Still everyone would know
Yes they would
It's always three am somewhere
You know it when you get there

Some people try to cover it up
Some people think it's never enough (never enough)

'Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side
Love will keep you up all night

I don't mean to scare you
But everybody has a first time
One day when you're old and gray
Don't look back and never say
You should have tried
Stayed up all night

Love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide

One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone

Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side
To the other side
Love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're cryin', you're cryin'
Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side

Love will keep you up all night
Love will keep you up all night

Love will keep you up all night[Brian:]
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace
You could be anyone today
Maybe I would recognize you On a crowded street

[AJ:]
Maybe you'll take me by surprise
Will you be the one I had in mind

[Chorus (emphasis on AJ):]
There'll come a day
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Face to face
Like I'm imagining
Baby how can I be sure
That you're the one I'm waiting for
Will you be unmistakable

[AJ:]
Unmistakable

[Nick:]
People say we're watching our lives
Through a glass
Desperately waiting on a chance
I know you're out there
Holding on, holding out for me

[AJ:]
How are we to know the time is right
What if you're here and I'm just blind

[Repeat Chorus (emphasis on Nick)]

[Nick:]
How can I know a song I never heard
How will I know your voice
When you haven't said a word

[AJ:]
How do I know how this will end
Before we begin

[Nick:]
Before we begin

[Howie:]
There'll come a day
When you walk out of my dreams

[All:]
Face to face (face to face)
Like I'm imagining (Like I'm imagining)
Baby, how can I be sure (how can I be sure)
That you're the one I'm waiting for (You're the one I'm waiting for)
Will you be (will you be)
Will you be (will you be)

[AJ:]
Unmistakable
UnmistakableHow come I was the last to know
Took the stage then you stole the show
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
I was captured by that stare
Now I'm shattered, but I don't care
And the people walking by don't have a clue

That I kissed your face
'Til the sun was in our eyes
'Til the afternoon arrived
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

Monday is a funny thing
Still waiting for the phone to ring
Will my imagination take it slow
After Saturday, my life is changed
In a moment it was rearranged
Strange how easy it is letting go
And I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes
And now I'm running blind

And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

This sweet relief
Unexpected things
Is this the end or only the beginning

I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes
Like the afternoon
Now I'm running blind (running blind)
I can't explain (can't explain)

Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love that's made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoonI been walking around
Inside a haze
Between the lines of reason
Hiding from the ghost
Of yesterday
Feels like I'm barely breathing

I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

I've been losin days
The shades pulled down
I still can't face the sun

But I-I'm goin crazy
I can't stay here
I've gone completely numb
I just wanna need someone
I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

Oh no
I thought you were the only one girl
But now I think I was wrong
Cause life goes on
Na na na na na

I've been walking around inside a haze

Oh I,

I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

In a downpour feel the rain
Feel the rain

I wanna feel the rainSo I lay awake another hour
Just like the one before
The shadows play a game with my head
I can't take this anymore

I hear the sound
Of my own breathing
It makes me miss you more

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Just leave me here in pieces
In pieces

I can't take the chance
Of running into
You running into me
So lock the door
And close the window
I just wanna see

Until the day
Inside my future
When I'll be on my feet

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Just leave me here in pieces
In pieces

If you want you can find me
On the dark side of the sun
Babe I don't wanna see what we've become
The damage has all been done

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
Wake me up when it's over
When the damage has all been done
The damage is done
I don't wanna be somewhere
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Leave me here in pieces
Just leave me in pieces
Just leave me in pieces
Just wake me up when it's over (in pieces)
Just wake me up when it's overLooking for beauty in a certain 
Finding the strength inside a gray 
Maybe I'm heading for a breakdown 
And maybe that's ok 
Could be I'm hanging on for dear life 
Maybe I need to get a grip 
Cause you're the only one 
That makes me feel like this 
So

[Chorus]
Save me I'm falling again 
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces 
In the end no matter what I do 
There's nowhere, nowhere to go 

Nowhere to go but you

Tryin' to make nothing out of something 
Promise myself I wouldn't care 
Maybe you're making me a liar cause I'm sitting here 
You finally crackin' my resistance 
And find a way to wear me down 

Yea, I just look at you 
And there's no way out 


Every single road I take (it's you) 
Asleep or wide awake (I know it's you) 
And it's too late for anyone to save me 

I'm falling again 
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces 

[Chorus: x2]

Nowhere to go but youOh oh oh
In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Oh oh

I looked down
And my shirt's turning red
I'm spinning around
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice
In my ear
Like I missed you
Want you tonight

[Chorus]
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Oh oh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
Oh oh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
(Soldier down) my heart

Thought I moved
More than on
Thought I could
Fool her charm
I really wanna go
But I can't leave her alone
Oh oh

Hear the sound
Of a love so loud
I just can't
I just can't
Ignore this feeling
Said she missed me
And she wants me
Wants me tonight

[Chorus]

In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest voice
A gunshot on the floor
Oh oh

[Chorus]

Straight through my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
My heart, my heart, my heart
Straight through my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
Oh ohFirst off I can't keep a promise
I'm no one to count on at all
Add on that I'm a coward
Too scared to return your call

But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger, than me
La la la la la la
'Cause you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

It's known that I'm a liar
Often I'm blacker than white
Add on my uncandid ego
No ones less humbled than I

But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger, than me
La la la la la la
'Cause you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

All the messed up things I do
Yeah I swear I'll make 'em up to you
Before you're going heaven knows
Just let me make it better
I'll try and measure up
I'll try and measure up to you
Oh yeah,

I'll make 'em up to you
Oh yeah!

But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger, than me
La la la la la la
'Cause you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Just bigger than me
La la la la la la
La la la la la laYeah, yeah, oh,
Yeah, yeah,

You should be right here laying next to me
But baby you chose to love the hard way
You could be right here getting the best of me
But baby you decided he was your man

And now that you're finding out
He's playing little games, you calling me again
You say you want me around
But I'm not sure now if I wanna be down
So

I think I wanna stay single
Maybe we're better apart
See I don't want a girl
That, only wanna come back
'Cause, some other man broke her heart

So bye bye love
Bye love
So bye bye love (Bye love)
Bye love
Yeah

Crazy how the tables turn
It wasn't long ago that you turned your back, no.
Saying there's no way that we can work (We can work)
And you were quick to move on to the next thing
Yeah.

And now that you're finding out
He's playing little games, you calling me again
You say you want me around
But I'm not sure now if I wanna be down

You need love (you need love)Life should be like a game of cards
You make a mistake
Shuffle the deck and start over
It should be just like drivin' in your car
Get lost and your navigation system
Gets you closer

But there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
Cause once you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back
Letting you go

If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this bed
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now

Wish I come with  remote controls
Then I just rewind into
The time it was better
It should have a restart button
So, I could travel right back
To the day that I met her

But there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
Cause when you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back
Letting you go

If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this bed
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now

Oh, oh, oh yeah
Cause there ain't no handbook (handbook)
You're on your own (your own)
Got no instructions (instructions)
When it comes to love (to love)
See once you do something (you do)
Can't be undone (undone)
Wish I could take back
Letting you go

If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this bed
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best

What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know nowGot a million reasons to run and hide
I don't blame you for being scared (for being scared, no)
'Bout a novel long, all the pain that he's caused you

Baby I'm fully aware (I'm fully aware)
If I could change the stories ending to me and you
Don't know the meaning of pretending what to do

[Chorus]
I could be the one
Give you all my love
Forget what he has done to you
I'm here now
Open up to me
Love will set you free
If ever you believe then 
Please believe in me
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
Let the world know baby
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
Let the world know baby, this is us

I know everything isn't meant to last
Box up all those photographs
Your moving on, yeah
I could flip back over that hour glass
And refill the better half (the better half)

And it's a miracle how broken hearts can mend
Won't you dry up all those tear drops and start again

[Chorus]

If I could show you there's no risk of being left alone
Would you let your past go
I'll take it slow
'Cause there's no need to rush when I knowIntimacy's
Fresh from my dreams
Over a triple X movie screen
I couldn't care less about being seen
A higher self esteem if you're on me?
(Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)
I say baby do you think
Sugar so sweet should rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me
Spoiled crazy

I said,
Public display of affection
(Gotta make 'em)
Pointing in that direction
(Watch me, watch me)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your P-D-A hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)
Your P-D-A, hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)

Remember at the beach we brought the sheets
We were harassed by police
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we be the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense can be intense
It's got me convinced, oh yeah
You're the fingers to my instrument

Public display of affection
(Gotta make 'em)
Pointing in that direction
(Watch me, watch me)
Public display of affection

And we're so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navho

(That's right)
Public display of affection
Mmm I want your PDAThis scenes so hypnotic
Smoking mirrors, lights and magic
Paper faces in gold
There's solider boys, beauty queens
Everyone's a mystery
It's got me losing control

Yearning, I'm yearning for the one to steal my eyes
Wanna play in this game of disguise 

It's a masquerade, a love parade
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All though the night and day
My masquerade, I need you baby
So stay with me tonight

Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade

Just like a perfect dream
I don't ever wanna leave
A thousand freaks in the show
One's a tiger, one's a lynx
One's a king that suffering
Moving high, moving love

Burning, I'm burning, can't you see it in my eyes?
Wanna play in this game of disguise 

It's a masquerade, a love parade
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All though the night and day
My masquerade, I need you baby
So stay with me tonight

Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade

I gotta know the girl behind the mask
Let me in, where you been, don't pretend
Dreamed that I had her alone
Show your face to me, we could be everything

It's a masquerade, a love parade
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All though the night and day
My masquerade, I need you baby
So stay with me tonight

A masquerade, a love parade
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All though the night and day
My masquerade, I need you baby
So stay with me tonight

Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masqueradeOh

Oh oh oh yeah
Oh no

Shorty ain't got cable,
She ain't even got a radio, way more than able.
What kinda girl should I take her for?
The perfect kind, just what I like,
Exactly what I had in my mind, a dream
She's a dream, yeah

Shorty don't know I'm on the red carpet, almost every night.
And when I'm outta town to go and do work,
I'm first class every flight.
If she takes the time to open her eyes,
She can realize that she's a dream
'Cause she knows me

'Cause Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.
But Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me
That's why I make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah
Make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah

Shorty don't know who I am

And I'm cool with that, if she says so
I ain't even got a lot to her
And when I'm out making pesos?
Ain't' nobody treat her like I do her.
'Cause I'm the one that she thinks about,
The only one on her mind,
She's a dream
'Cause she knows me
And Shorty don't know that I'm on the stage,
Like three or four times a week
She don't even know I've been around the world
And all the different girls I meet.
But there's just one, face that I see
She's the only one for me
She's a dream
'Cause she knows me

'Cuase Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me
That's why I make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah
Make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah
(She's a dream)

See, shorty don't know who I am
That's not good for us, 'cause I know,
It's not good to fuss
And I know she loves me, for me
And I love her, for her
But It wouldn't work if she ever gave
A damn 'bout who I am but she knows me

She don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me
Oh,
Make her say, ah
Make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah

'Bout me
(She's a dream)So empty, can't feel no more,
As I'm left with my tears on the floor
I wait for my heart to mend,
But you keep tearing a hole

Inside, I'm so lost,
In the middle of my heart
It's a battlefield of love,
I've been fighting for too long

And now I'm shattered,
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(But it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

What am I still here for,
Could it be that I'm just waiting
Hoping you'd rescue me,
And put the pieces together again

Inside, I'm so lost,
In the middle of my heart
It's a battlefield of love,
I've been fighting for too long

And now I'm shattered
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(But it slipped from you hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

Tell me what you're really here for,
If you never really loved me
I gave my all but it still wasn't enough

Cause all you had to say was that you ain't
Looking for commitment
Instead of telling me what I wanted to hear, hey

You took my emotions
And scattered them on the ground
So hard to just pick up,
And move on with life, again

And now I'm shattered
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(But it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

Can't believe, you and me, ahhYour words burn, they're melting
What we have, I'm breaking down
No reason, no warning, no love loss
You might as well

Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
Take our memories, throw them all aside
I hope you finally get what you want
Now you know

I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love without ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

I can't feel without ya
You know I can't deal without ya
And now I got a life without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

And this constant echoing
In my head,
I'm spinning 'round
You seem so unaffected
While I go on in this hell

Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
Take our memories, throw them all aside
I hope you finally get what you want
Now you know

I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love without ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

I can't feel without ya
You know I can't deal without ya
And now I got a life without ya
And it's killing me
That we can be undone

We can be undone

You're talking now
And I'm hearin' everything that you say
And I'm holding on is a real phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave
It's dragging me to my grave

You're talking now
And I'm hearin' everything that you say
And I'm holding on is a real phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave

I didn't wanna live without ya

I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

I can't feel without you, 
You know I can't deal without you
And now I got a life without you, and it's killing me
That we could be undone

I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love with ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

I can't feel without you, 
You know I can't deal without you
And now I got a life without you, and it's killing me
That we could be undoneEverybody grove to the music

And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I see 

And girl I'm going out of my mind 
I miss ya so much, I don't know what to do 
Please say its just a matter of time, 
Until I feel your touch, 
Until you let me come back to you 

I think about you girl every time at night 
I'm in love, and it feels so right 
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain 
I was just caught up in the lying game 
But now those days are over, I've changed my ways 
Now I'm counting the minutes, I'm counting the days 
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start 
To find a new way to get back into your heart 

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I seeBaby, can I talk to you?
I know something's wrong
Things just ain't the same
But deep down inside
I know you still care
So tell me what to do
To get things back
The way they used to be

If your words had meaning
If you really cared about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart
If you were my lover
A constant friend to me
Tell me why
Would you turn away from my love

Then maybe you wouldn't shut me out your life, baby

When they criticize every move you make 
And you've had as much as you're gonna take 
Don't you worry

Nobody understands a man

When you give your heart but you don't get much 
Don't you worry the time is gonna come

I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't know)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (yeah)
As long as you love me
As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did (yeah)
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love meI don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know
But if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine!

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

To you, hey girl
Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
I Love You

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you
My love is all I have to give

My love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you

I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you[Chorus]
Oh baby I'm missing you 
We used the love so strong 
Tell me where do we go 
Oh baby I'm missing you 
They said I'd learn to forget but it sure ain't happen yet 

Been checkin' out the places where we used to go 
Been lookin' for your face inside the crowd 
I've been talkin' to the people what we used to know 
Nobody wants to say where you hang out

And when I call your phone 
Seems like you're never home 
And you don't return my call 
It tears me apart 
This is breakin' up my heart 

[Chorus]

I still have your pictures hung around my room 
That's the only thing that is left of you with me 
Girl what can I do to make you come back soon
And make it just the way it used to be

Oh, this is someone new 
Can never go on without you 
Girl I don't want to think about it 
I can't sleep at night 
No this can't be right 
Come back into my life 
(Come back baby come back) 

[Chorus]

I know there's a chance for you and I 
And I believe there's no way our love could die 
So no matter how long it takes I'll wait for you 
And what ever it takes I'll be there for you 
I'll be there, I'll be there 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]Hey, yeah
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
That's the way I like it
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)

Somebody told me that you're not my kind
So have I lost my mind? (That's the way I like it)
You keep on doing all the things I like
You've got me hypnotized
But that's the way I like it

Girl you make me wanna move
It's the price I got to pay
For all the things you do
But I like it
You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

Oh, mystery lady, you've got somethin' I like
Tell me you're here to stay (ooh yeah)
You're dangerous, oh baby
Could you do me right?
Will you come out to play?
'Cause that's the way I like it

Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on

Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)

Everybody come on

Everybody come on

You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
Hey, yeah!

That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it (everybody now)
That is the way I like it (everybody now)
That's the way that I like it (everybody come on)

(That's the way that, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)
(That's the way)Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh, what a life
Once we were dreamers just dreamers we were
Oh, you and I
Now I see you're just somebody who wastes all my time and money
What a lie, you and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

Once I could handle the truth
When the truth was you and I
But time after time all the
Promises turned out to be all lies
Now I see I'm just somebody who wasted my time and money
What a lie (what a lie, what a lie, oh)
You and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

You said "I'll take you back"
But I closed the door 'cause I don't want
10,000 more
Oh

10,000 promises yeah (oh)
10,000 promises you gave to me

Repeat chorus
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me (That you gave to me)
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me
Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh you and I
What a lieIf I could right the wrongs that made you cry 
I make a promise not to say good-night
"Cause I'm holding on 
With a love so strong
And I can't take a day without you by my side

Girl if i could change
If I could change your mind
Baby you could  help me wipe these tears from my eyes

[Chorus]
Girl don't stop
The sun from shining down on me 
'Cause  I can't face another day without your smile
And if you take away the love and arms that surround me 
The I might break down and cry just like a child

Girl,I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me
So I'm pressin' on
I hope you understand
There's a broken heart that lies inside your hands

So if I could change 
And it won't hurt your pride
Baby you could help me stop these tears that I cry

[Chorus]

Like a child 
Just like a child
With the spirits running free 
She showed my why
Oh, she did

Like a child(oh baby)
Just like a child
Think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
Like a child

[Chorus]do, da da da da
do, da da da da
do, da da da da

The candle plays the hourglass
Days go and all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
Every smile even all the reasons why
You say I pushed you out of my life

Chorus
Baby you set me (ha-ha-ahhh)
Baby you set me (do da da da da)
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you set me 
Set adrift on memory bliss

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with 
The biggest empty void 
I've ever had in life (ever had in life)
Bet you say that I don't care
Bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there 
when the mornin comes
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life)
Baby will you be there
When I open my eyes
After all the time I've spent 
Wishing you

Chorus

Sadness has overwhelmed me
my mind flies carelessly 
I Imagine that you're happy 
With your life right now
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things
That I could never have

Chorus to fade
The candle plays the hourglass
The days go and all I do is
Think of you and wonder where you are at night
Oh I remember everything
Every smile, and even all
The reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my life

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life (ever had in life) ohh
Bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there when the morning comes?
(Baby will you be there?)
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life, baby)
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes?
After all the time I've spent, wishing you

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind flies and carelessly
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now oh
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things that I can never have

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

So come on now
I know this much is true
I know this much is trueThere are people who say what you want to hear 
Even on a rainy day they'll tell you the sky is clear 
When you really, really love someone 
And I'm right when I say that you want them near 
And if you can't even tell 
Them things that they want to hear 

[Chorus]
Always forever, all the things she said 
Never say never, those simple lies that she fed 
I will never leave you 
All the love I thought she had 
But can you blame me, no, 
'Cause that's what she said 
That's what she said 
She told me we'd see forever 
That's what she said, she said, yeah 

And,
There are people who that say what they really mean 
She said she'd always be there 
She said she'd always care 
But just when you think that you can trust that someone ya love 
Tell me why do you know 
How stars can fall from above 

[Chorus]

'Cause you made promises that you couldn't keep 
But you're not hurting' yourself 
But you're only hurting me (you're only hurting me) 
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean 
Oh how can I make you see just-a what you did to me 

Oh, you said how much you really cared 
Just when I thought I was in love 
Girl, how could you dare 
If I were you I wouldn't lie not even-a once 
To the face of the one that I love so much 

[Chorus]

Oh that's what she saidIf you want it to be good girl

When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive

All you people can't you see, can't you see

You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way

Am I, your fire?
Your one, desire

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way

Now I can see that we've fallen apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

You are my fire
The one desire
You are (you are, you are, you are)

Don't want to hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache

'Cause I want it that wayShow me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze upon me
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be
You're asking me
To feel the things you never show

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are (where you are)

You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture
On the Backstreet's Back, alright
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed baby
But I should have known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with
Don't, don't want you back

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I, I don't want you back

You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go

That I could control this
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you, baby
Girl if only I knew what I've done
You know, so why don't you tell me
And I, I would bring down the moon and the sun
To show how much I care

Don't want to lose you now
Baby, I know we can win this
Don't want to lose you now
No no, or ever again

I've got this feeling you're not gonna stay
It's burning within me
The fear of losing
Of slipping away
It just keeps getting closer, baby
Whatever reason to leave that I've had
My place was always beside you
And I wish that I didn't need you so bad
Your face just won't go away

And find a way back to your heart (back to your heart)Here we are in the arms of one another
And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong and love is right
For us tonight

When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

Let it be (let it be) if we're nothing more than dreamers
Who believe (who believe) that we see no wall between us
How can they be in my heart (in my heart) and in my mind (in my mind)
When all I could find

When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

I loved you from a distance
Thought I couldn't reach that far
I can't believe how close that we are (believe how close we are, ooh ooh)
When I look into your Spanish eyes
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes (ooh yeah)When we turn out the lights
The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
But girl you know that I would never
Ever let another's touch
Come between the two of us

'Cause no one else will ever take your place

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder
You're my dream come true, oh yeah
Girl you know I'll always treasure
Every kiss and everyday 
I'll love you girl in every way
And I always will, 'cause in my eyes

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much

(Girl can't you see that) No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally, babe
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

No one else comes close
Oh girl, oh oh
No one else comes closeIt takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I want to thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
Be the perfect son

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

You showed me how to love (you showed me how to love)
You showed me how to care (you showed me how to care)
You showed me that you would
Always be there
I want to thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine

You showed me (you showed me)
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands

You know you always were

I love you mom"Hello"
"Hi, it's me, what's up, baby?
I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight
So don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"Say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really dropping out
I think my battery must be low
Listen, if you can hear me
We're going to a place nearby, alright?
Gotta go!"

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should've said, "No, someone's waiting for me"
But I called my girl up and said

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Listen, baby, I'm sorry (hello?)
Listen, baby, I'm sorry (hello?)
Gotta go

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
Gotta go

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"Yeah, yeah

Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become, oh yeah

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful, loneliness that's tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (trying)
I played my part, kept you in the dark (in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark (keep you in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (trying to be someone)
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart (now let me show you the shape of my heart)
Looking back on the things I've done

Now let me show you the shape of

Show you the shape of my heartBackstreet
Check it uh
Hey

Let's talk about one, baby
You gotta hear me out
Did you really think I'd be the last to know
What it's all about

Let's talk about you
You say 
He's the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't want to know

I'm tellin' you he'll eat you up from inside
And then he doesn't want to know

[Chorus]
Listen I mean it
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another player
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

Let's talk about what he's done (he's done)
To become your number one
Or was it all the promises of diamonds, pearls and party dresses
That turn you on
I've seen it before (dont take!)
Anymore, free too
You're through for sure
Just go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up
I'm tellin' you to go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up

Listen I mean it (I mean it)
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another player (player)
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end (must come to an end)
Get another boyfriend

All right 
Yeah
Get another boyfriend
Stop
Hey

Hear me out
You must know (you must know)
What it's all about (baby)
That he's just a player in love (love)
This must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

[Chorus: x2][Chorus]
You're my shining star
That is what you are
There is no one like you baby
Angels everywhere
Every time you're near
You will always be my baby

Baby when you do the things you do
I want to be close to you
Cause I need to feel your every move, oh
Baby I can never say how much
I need your touch, I can't get enough
Cause you know what to do to turn me on, yeah

[Chorus]

Baby you're as close as close can get
And baby you know I'd let
Every single part of me be yours, ooh yeah
It doesn't matter if the phone might ring
Cause I won't hear a thing when I'm in your arms
Cause you know what to do to turn me on

[Chorus]

I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
Cause you are doing everything so right
Oh, oh baby
I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
Cause you are doing everything so right
Oh, oh baby

[Chorus]

You know that I adore you
want to be there everyday for you
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby
You know that I adore you
want to be there everyday for you
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby

[Chorus]It's in the silences, the words you never say
I see it in your eyes, always starts the same way
It seems like everyone we know is breaking up
Does anybody ever stay in love, anymore?

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

I see you look at me when you think I'm not aware
You're searching for clues of just how deep my feelings are
How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide?
All I know is what I feel when I look into your eyes

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything that I am

Oh, there are no guarantees
That's what you always say to me
But late at night I feel the tremble in your touch
But what I'm trying to say to you
I've never said to anyone

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

You're everything I am
With everything I am
You see me sitting here
A smile upon my face
The time has come but you know that it's not too late
There's been too many things
Together we have seen
It's not that hard if we start to believe
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

This world is not at ease
We seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only so much we can really do
It's up to you and me
To fix our destiny
The jury's here, so let's take the stand
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

So tell me why we have to cry (and not try)
When there's so many things we can do
To help this troubled world start anew

I need a reason, I need a sign
There's no turning back, I'm here by your side
Is it today or maybe tonight, we'll find
The answer to our life

Show me the way
Give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today, is it tonight
The answer to our life

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our lifeWe've been through days of thunder
Some people say we don't belong
They try to pull us under
But here we stand together in the new year strong

Let's get on with the show
(Let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are
And this one goes out to

[Chorus]
Everyone (yeah) , everyone, everyone
This one goes out to you,
Everyone
We're standing stronger 'cause' of what you've done
This one goes out to you

We've been inside the circus
We take the pleasure with the pain
I guess there's something about us
Whatever comes around will always stay the same
Oh yeah 

Let's get on with the show
(Oh let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are 
(we know who you are)

[Chorus]

Now we're minutes away
Till it's time to play
Our heartbeats are rising
They're letting you in
Time for the show to begin

Here
We're standing stronger from what you've done
This one goes out to you, you, you
You make us feel like we've just begun
And this one goes out to you... yeah

[Chorus: x2]I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
What's the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong
I heard him promise you forever
But forever's come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines, oh

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than that

Baby, you deserve much better
What's the use in holding on
Don't you see it's now or never
'Cause I just can't be friends
Baby knowing in the end, that

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

There's not a day that passes by
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
It's not too late to change your mind
So take my hand, don't say goodbye

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than that

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than thatI know that I
I can't believe
Just what the path has brought me
To the man I want to be
And I know that we
Have had some times
That we can't forget the struggle
Cause we have so far to go

I know we have changed
But change can be so good
So lets not forget why it's understood
That

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through
Time (time)
Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)
Time
(goes on and on) Goes on and on everyday
Baby time is what is, come what may

I remember when
Mom used to say
That things are getting better
And you'll soon be on your way
Remember those days
That we would sing at the drop of a dime
Way back when nothing else mattered

I know we have changed
But change can be so good
So lets not forget why it's understood
That

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through
Time (time)
Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)
Time
(goes on and on) Goes on and on everyday

So here we are (here we are)
And we'll always stick together
And through it all you know we owe it all
To you (time goes on, it never stops, it keeps on)

I was looking for something
On the crime scene where you're in too deep
I found a note with his number
It's just another clue (that leads to you)

I got a little suspicious
I got a feeling that you ain't true to me
I should've known better
Than to buy your lie (your sweet disguise)

Yeah
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
that you're not for me babe

No no, uh uh
Things will never be the same again with you
No no, uh uh
Now I know what it's comin' to
No no, uh uh
'cause' if you think that it's the way
That love should be
Let me tell you it's not for me

No no

I don't want to be part of your screenplay
Just tell me
Did you rehearse on me?
Now give me the story
On baby who's to blame (maybe I am)
Caught in the middle
And I'm tired of your games of hide and seek
I'm getting a feeling
That it's time for me to leave

You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
That you're not for me babe

No no, uh uh
Things will never be the same again with you
No no, uh uh
Now I know what it's comin' to
No no, uh uh

That love should be
Let me tell you it's not for me

Yeah (yeah)
I said no no (no way)
No no, no no (whoa)

I had enough of your talk, your games
And you won't go away
Justify my reasons to say
(Say, reasons to say)

No no, uh uh
Things will never be the same again with you
No no, uh uh
Now I know what it's comin' to
No no, uh uh

The way you make me feel inside

And I'm sorry for the things I did,
For your teardrops, or the words I said.
Can you forgive me and open your heart once again?  Oh yeah.

It's true.  I mean it.
From the bottom of my heart.
Yeah, it's true.
Without you I would fall apart.

Whatever happened, I know that I was wrong. Oh yes.

But I love you and I always will,
So I wonder if you want me still.
Can you forgive me and open your heart once again?
Oh yeah.

It's true.  I mean it.

Yeah, it's true.
Without you I would fall apart.

It's true.  I mean it.
From the bottom of my heart.
Yeah, it's true.
Without you I would fall apart.

It's true.Remember when
Never needed each other
The best of friends
Like sister and brother
We understood
We'd never be alone

Those days are gone
Now I want you so much
The night is long
And I need your touch
Don't know what to say
Never meant to feel this way
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

I hear your voice
And I start to tremble
Brings back the child that
I resemble

I cannot pretend
That we can still be friends
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

I want to say this right
And it has to be tonight
Just need you to know

I don't want to live this life
I don't want to say goodbye
With you I want to spend
The rest of my life

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
Everything's changed
We never knew
How did I fall in love with youEmpty spaces fill me up with hopes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me I can't find no rest
Where I'm going is anybody's guess

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't want to make you face this world alone
I want to let you go

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

IncompleteLooking at your picture from when we first met
You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night

Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

All the doors are closing I'm tryin' to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day, the day you slipped away

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

That since I lost you, I lost myself
No I can't fake it, there's no one else

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to knowEverybody knows that I was such a fool to ever let go of you
And baby I was wrong
And yeah I know I said we'd be better off alone
It was time that we moved on
I know I broke your heart, I didn't mean to break your heart

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you.

I know you aren't there and you can make me wait, but I'm not gonna wait
It's the that least I could do, just to tell you face to face
I was lying to myself, now I'm dying in this hell
Girl I know you're mad
I can't blame you for being mad

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and now I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you

If you could see these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
Hear the heart that's barely beating, you would see a different man

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to youHey hey hey

The sun is over the city but it's an orange day
There is reason for lookin' up but I'm feelin' down
You see, I've got to catch a plane but won't buy a ticket
'Cause its' hard to just stop when you're spinnin' around

It's a weird world, don't you know it?
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world, no matter how you roll it

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love
It's a weird world, yeah

Sent a message to a G.I. in the desert
Said thank you man for bringin' another dawn
Back here it's her and me and we're havin' our first baby
He's out there takin' 'em on

It's a weird world and I know you know it
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world, no matter how you roll it

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love

I'm closin' my eyes but I'm startin' to see
While he's lookin' at you, she's lookin' at me
The only thing it does
Is just keep me away from you

Sure, part of this place would cheer if I die
But don't let them take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way for you to decide it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love

Hey hey hey

Hey hey hey

Hey hey hey
(Oh, it's a weird world, don't you know it?)
Hey hey heyWho are you now?
Are you still the same
Or did you change somehow?
What do you do
At this very moment when I think of you?
And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
Do you remember that?

No matter how I fight it
Can't deny it
Just can't let you go

I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

Now look at me
Instead of moving on, I refuse to see
That I keep coming back
And I'm stuck in a moment
That wasn't meant to last (to last)

I've tried to fight it
Can't deny it
You don't even know

That I still need you

Julie was a long way from home
She can make alone look pretty
Her attitude made a part of her landscape
Riding her bike through alphabet city

She likes to party in the backseat, under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise
She said "what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
She can lick her lips and smile and make you want to believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl
(Right now right now ooh ooh ooh)

Julie likes to shop lift in stores
Right alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stop
And make love on the floor until the camera made us

And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire
When she walked, I followed, when she laughed, I cried,
"What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
And I was wrapped around her finger, and I began to believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Tell me what you want from me
I've got everything you need
It's getting hard for me to breathe
Let me be your guarantee

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (a game)
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day (by day)
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl (poster girl)

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (just a game)
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Right now, right now
Right now, oh oh oh
Poster girl
Poster girl
Come on, come onOh, no

Take what you need 'cause I can't hold my breath
Say what you feel 'cause I've got nothing left, oh
I made a promise to myself last night
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

It wouldn't matter anyway, don't change a thing
You're perfect as you are, time has a way, time is all I've got
If my heart should shatter watching you
There'd be one less thing I'd have to prove

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

Heaven will be waiting when I fall into your lovely arms
I believe you'll find me there
You'll find me there

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'll take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

Wouldn't matter, anywayClose your eyes, make a wish
That this could last forever
If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now

Yeah, it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

Take my hand, take my life
Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain kept inside, yeah
There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now

Yeah, it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

It's an illusion
How can I feel this way if I can't have you?
It's an illusion
Nothing is real this way if I can't have you

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
(I don't wanna know)
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
(I'm climbing the walls)
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

I can't let you go, no

And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss, I miss youNo no baby 
How can I begin to tell you 
What you do to me every time I hear ya 
More willing to want to see ya 
I know that there's no use in 
Tryin' to explain the confusion 
But still I'm not complainin' 
'Bout my situation 
Let's not talk about a possible ending 

The very first time that I 
was lookin' to be your fella 
I found my inspiration 
hidin' in your expression 
So I put myself on forward 
for your consideration 

[Chorus]
Let's not talk about a possible ending 
Let's not think about it every day 
And I know I'm so in love with you 
I'm finding it harder and harder to breathe 
Every time I'm near a beautiful woman 

And so we put the top down 
To take you drivin' downtown 
I guess we'll know just what to do 
When you're lookin' to fool around 
It's too late to stop me 
I know we're gonna get down, get down, oh no 

[Chorus] 

My beautiful woman 
My beautiful woman 
Yes you are, yes you are 
My beautiful woman 
Anything that you want me to, I'll do 
My beautiful

be	 is for beautiful as the sunshine 
E tells me everything's feelin' alright 
A goes to you and me swingin' it down 
T is two, I want you 
You've got me actin' like a fool 

[Chorus: x2]

My beautiful woman 
My beautiful woman 
Yes you are, yes you are 
My beautiful woman 
You're so beautiful 
My beautiful woman 
My beautiful womanYeah, yeah 
It seems like yesterday when I said "I do" 
And after all this time my heart still burns for you 
If you don't know by now that you're my only one 
Take a look inside me and watch my heartstrings come undone 

I know I promised you forever 
Is there no stronger word I can use 
To reassure you when the storm is raging outside 
You're my safest place to hide 

Can you see me, here I am 
I need you like I needed you then 
When I feel like giving up 
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine 
You're my safest place to hide 

You see colors no one else can see 
In every breath you hear a symphony 
You understand me like nobody can 
I feel like my soul unfolding like a flower blooming 

When this whole world gets too crazy 
And there's nowhere left to go 
I know you give me sanctuary 
You're the only truth I know 
You're the road back home 

Can you see me, here I am 
Standing here where I've always been 
And when words are not enough 
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine 
You're my safest place to hide 
My safest place to hide 

I know I promised you forever 
There's no stronger word I can use 
To reassure when the storm is raging outside 
You're my safest place to hide 

Oh! Can you see me, here I am 
Standing here where I've always been 
When I feel like giving up 
I promise inside your heart I'd still find 
Yeah, yeah 
You're my safest place to hide, oh yeah 
You're my safest place to hideWhen you come back I won't be here
She said and gently pulled me near
If you want to talk you can call
I know it's not your fault

I just smiled and said let go of me
But there's something that I've just gotta know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said it's not my fault

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been

Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head

When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too
When the one that you want doesn't want you

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

Siberia, Siberia
When the one you want doesn't want you tooI really miss you
There's something that I gotta say

The things we did,
the things we said,
Keep coming back to me and make me smile again.
You showed me how to face the truth.
Everything that's good in me, I owe to you.

Though the distance that's between us now, may seem to be too far.
It will never separate us, deep inside I know you are

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)
Never Gone

No, no, no

I walk along these empty streets.
There is not a second you're not here with me.
The love you gave, the grace you've shown,
Will always give me strength and be my corner stone.
Some how you found a way to see the best I have in me.
As long as time goes on, I swear to you that you will be

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)

Never gone from me
If there's one thing I believe
I believe
I will see you somewhere down the road again.

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)
Never Gone

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)
Never GoneLast night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
Sunday afternoonWalking along the sky
Chasing a glimpse of you
Painting a world with stars I found inside your eyes
Up here above the haze
Everything looks so clear
Wondering what it would be like if you were here

And time takes time ([Howie:] takes time)
But I can't wait
To tell you how I feel

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

I hold you close when it all goes crazy
And through it all, you'll be my lady
Why, tell me why
You're everything
Everything but mine

You don't have to be afraid
Of somebody else's touch
Just gimme a chance to prove
Just how you should be loved

And time, it takes time ([Howie:] takes time)
It's not too late
To tell you how I feel

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

Everything but mine
Mine I know, oh baby
Someday you'll come around
I'm gonna leave the light on
And I won't let you down
No I won't let you down

I won't let you down

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

You're everything but mine
You're everything but mine
You're the sun, you're the star
You're the moon, you're the rain
Love your lips, love your eyes
Drivin' me insane, oh baby, baby
Everything but mine
You're everything but mineI close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I wanna let you walk away tonight without a word

I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling
Oh, if you were here right now,
I swear I'd tell you this

Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin it inside, it's killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

I climb the walls, yeah
I can see the edge,
But I can't take the fall, no
I've memorized the number
So why can't I make the call
Maybe 'cause I know you'll always be with me
In the possibility

Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin it inside, it's killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

No, no, no

I don't wanna be like this
I just wanna let you know
That everything I hold in
Is everything I can't let go (oh, can't let go)

'Cause

Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin it inside, it's killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

Don't you know it baby
I don't wanna waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'm inconsolable
Whoa yeah
I'm inconsolableHere we are, seven days
And seven nights of empty tries
It's ritual, habitual
But it's never gonna work this time

We're to the point of no return
And along the way the only thing we've learned
Is how to hurt each other

I'm looking back and wondering why
It took so long to realize
That nothing's changed, it never will
All these years of standing still
And still we stay in all this pain
And nothing's gonna make it go away

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know

So save your voice
Don't waste your breath
Can't you see we're at the end
And this goodbye is permanent
So wish me well and try to forget

And all the fights
And all the ways
We almost made it
But we never did
And it's finally come to this

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know

We can not hide what we've become
So sick and tired of being numb
It's done, it's done
It's done

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No, you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
'Cause I know, I know, I know
'Cause I know, 'cause I knowShe keeps her secrets
In her eyes
She wraps the truth
Inside her lies
Just when I can't say
What she's done to me
She comes to me
And leads me back to paradise

She's so hard to hold
But I can't let go

I'm a house of cards
In a hurricane
A reckless ride
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She tears away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles

Oh when she smiles

Maybe I'd fight if I could
It hurts so bad
But feels so good
She opens up just like
A rose to me
When she's close to me
Anything she'd ask me to
I would

It's out of control
But I can't let go

I'm a house of cards
In a hurricane
A reckless ride
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She tears away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles

When she looks at me
I get so weak

I'm a house of cards
In a hurricane
A reckless ride
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She tears away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles[Nick:]
There you go caught you crashin' my dreams again
Just when I'm trying to get over you
I tell my heart but I can't seem to comprehend
A day without you

[AJ:]
Now you've carved out a life
But I wear the scars
Reminding me by the hour
That it's time to accept that's the way the things are
I wish I could but

[Chorus:]
I can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why it can't be any other way
Any other way

[Brian:]
Since you drained all the color out of the sky
How am I supposed to feel?
It's like I'm livin' in somebody else's life
Tell me it's not real

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

[Howie:]
Like we never had a falling out
Like the tears had never hit the ground
Like you're still here
You're still here

[Brian:]
Since you drained all the color out of the sky

[Repeat Chorus 2x][AJ/Nick:]
She wakes up with the sun
She throws on her clothes
Hoping her car will start
The second time around
The day has begun
The line's out the door
Serving up fraps
Until she can't take anymore
I see it in her broken smile
Oh why

[Chorus:]
Wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way

[Howie/Nick:]
No she never looks my way
She never, never, ever looks my way
She ties up her hair
Her makeup is smeared
Wiping the tears that she wants no one to see
She screams on the pain
I hear every word
Why don't you know how beautiful you are
Just see it in my broken smile

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Brian/Howie:]
If I could be the light
To guide you through the darkness baby
If I could be the one
To change the ending to your story
I'd be one in a million
I'd be one in a million
Someday I will tell her
You're gonna work it out somedayStop it, stop it
Stop it, stop it
Go, stop and go
I just hit static
I used to read you
Loud and clear
Not like this
It's so erratic

And I'm not rational
When I see you around
Your inconsistency
And you know it's dragging me down
You're so conflicted baby

You're always walking away
One step and everything's over
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
I'm already dead
I already said (I already said) I'm sorry

Stop it
I've made mistakes
I've been an addict
A blind fanatic
Don't you know
You're not immune to the panic
With somebody

When the snow hits your skin
The cold don't last forever
But you're livin' again
If you don't let seasons change


How many times do I have to say it
Before you believe me

Stop it, stop it
Stop and go

Panic!I can see in your eyes
Broken windows, fallen skies
Baby, baby what you hidin' from
The light that followed you around
Lately nowhere to be found
Don't you know that I'm your place to run

You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know

That you can let go

Sifting through shattered dreams
Livin' in the in between
Baby, babe it's gonna be alright
(You can let go)
When you're lost, let down, disappointed
And jerked around in this cold, cold world
I will always be by your side

You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
There ain't nothin' you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know

That you can let go

Don't be afraid when you're falling apart
Don't hesitate I'll be right where you are
Open your eyes there's a crack in the dark

Never let me see you cry
You locked it somewhere deep inside
Baby, baby let me hold you tight

Make it alright

Baby, baby gonna be alright
Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you (I won't turn against you)
Not letting it show
Baby, babe gonna be alright
Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you
You can let go

You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
You can let go
There ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to knowHow come you never know
What you got until it's gone
Too bad
Because I never felt so good with anyone
How fooled was I into thinking
I was gonna be alright
Okay
Fine

So every day I try a little harder
To forget her
Lie here convince myself
Tomorrow will be better

The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of her memory
And now I know what it is
Love is what the trouble is
Love is what the trouble is

How come she said
You never wear your heart
Where I can see
Too bad
'Cause now I'm the one
Who's sorry
How stupid was I into thinking
I was gonna be alright
Okay
Fine
So everyday I find a little something
To remind me
No matter how I try
I can't put the past behind me

The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of her memory
And now I know what it is

Love has let me go
I'm alright, I'm okay
I'll be fine, give it time

But the only trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone (she's gone)
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of her memory (I just can't)
And now I know what it is (yes I do)
And now I know what it is
'Cause love is what the trouble is
The trouble
Love, love is what the trouble is[AJ:]
The first night that we met
I will never forget
Baby, you were a star
From that point in time
It was always you and I shining
So beautiful
When we're out with your friends
You treat me like I'm dead
It was like I'm invisible

[Nick:]
(I can't let it go)
That was unforgettable
(I can't let it go)
I just wanna let you know
(I can't let it go)
Situations unlivable
(I can't let it go)
I can't let it go
(I can't let it go)

[Chorus:]
Tell me what you say that you want me
All you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
Make me say oh no
I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right

[Brian:]
Oh, you got me twisted
Oh, you got me twisted
I'm not someone you can just disrespect
How would you feel if you were in my shoes
Feelin' used with your heart bruised

[Nick:]
(I can't let it go)
The situations critical
(I can't let it go)
Relationship is pitiful
(I can't let it go)
Everything's falling apart
(I can't let it go)
Cause you're so hypocritical

[Repeat Chorus]

[All:]
You're just no good for me
You're no good for me
You're just no good for me
I know you're no good for me

[Howie:]
You know
It's wrong to treat me cold
I've no one to hold
One day I'm gonna say goodbye
What's it gonna be
Girl I'm gonna leave
Unless you turn around
And treat me right

[Repeat Chorus]

[Howie:]
Just treat me right
Just treat me right

[Brian:]
Say that you want me

[Howie:]
Just treat me right
Just treat me right

[Repeat Chorus]I won't tell nobody
I'll just scream it in my mind
Nothing good in life is scripted
It's not like we predicted
That the one you want
Is gonna be the one you thought

I won't tell nobody
But I won't live like a prisoner
Nothing has to be so perfect
Can you tell me was it worth it
Because her heart can't lie
And even though her face may try
Love can keep you up all night

'Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side
Love will keep you up all night

If I don't tell a living soul
Still everyone would know
Yes they would
It's always three am somewhere
You know it when you get there

Some people try to cover it up
Some people think it's never enough (never enough)

'Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side
Love will keep you up all night

I don't mean to scare you
But everybody has a first time
One day when you're old and gray
Don't look back and never say
You should have tried
Stayed up all night

Love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide

One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone

Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side
To the other side
Love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're cryin', you're cryin'
Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side

Love will keep you up all night
Love will keep you up all night

Love will keep you up all night[Brian:]
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace
You could be anyone today
Maybe I would recognize you On a crowded street

[AJ:]
Maybe you'll take me by surprise
Will you be the one I had in mind

[Chorus (emphasis on AJ):]
There'll come a day
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Face to face
Like I'm imagining
Baby how can I be sure
That you're the one I'm waiting for
Will you be unmistakable

[AJ:]
Unmistakable

[Nick:]
People say we're watching our lives
Through a glass
Desperately waiting on a chance
I know you're out there
Holding on, holding out for me

[AJ:]
How are we to know the time is right
What if you're here and I'm just blind

[Repeat Chorus (emphasis on Nick)]

[Nick:]
How can I know a song I never heard
How will I know your voice
When you haven't said a word

[AJ:]
How do I know how this will end
Before we begin

[Nick:]
Before we begin

[Howie:]
There'll come a day
When you walk out of my dreams

[All:]
Face to face (face to face)
Like I'm imagining (Like I'm imagining)
Baby, how can I be sure (how can I be sure)
That you're the one I'm waiting for (You're the one I'm waiting for)
Will you be (will you be)
Will you be (will you be)

[AJ:]
Unmistakable
UnmistakableHow come I was the last to know
Took the stage then you stole the show
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
I was captured by that stare
Now I'm shattered, but I don't care
And the people walking by don't have a clue

That I kissed your face
'Til the sun was in our eyes
'Til the afternoon arrived
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

Monday is a funny thing
Still waiting for the phone to ring
Will my imagination take it slow
After Saturday, my life is changed
In a moment it was rearranged
Strange how easy it is letting go
And I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes
And now I'm running blind

And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

This sweet relief
Unexpected things
Is this the end or only the beginning

I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes
Like the afternoon
Now I'm running blind (running blind)
I can't explain (can't explain)

Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love that's made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoonI been walking around
Inside a haze
Between the lines of reason
Hiding from the ghost
Of yesterday
Feels like I'm barely breathing

I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

I've been losin days
The shades pulled down
I still can't face the sun

But I-I'm goin crazy
I can't stay here
I've gone completely numb
I just wanna need someone
I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

Oh no
I thought you were the only one girl
But now I think I was wrong
Cause life goes on
Na na na na na

I've been walking around inside a haze

Oh I,

I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

In a downpour feel the rain
Feel the rain

I wanna feel the rainSo I lay awake another hour
Just like the one before
The shadows play a game with my head
I can't take this anymore

I hear the sound
Of my own breathing
It makes me miss you more

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Just leave me here in pieces
In pieces

I can't take the chance
Of running into
You running into me
So lock the door
And close the window
I just wanna see

Until the day
Inside my future
When I'll be on my feet

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Just leave me here in pieces
In pieces

If you want you can find me
On the dark side of the sun
Babe I don't wanna see what we've become
The damage has all been done

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
Wake me up when it's over
When the damage has all been done
The damage is done
I don't wanna be somewhere
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Leave me here in pieces
Just leave me in pieces
Just leave me in pieces
Just wake me up when it's over (in pieces)
Just wake me up when it's overLooking for beauty in a certain 
Finding the strength inside a gray 
Maybe I'm heading for a breakdown 
And maybe that's ok 
Could be I'm hanging on for dear life 
Maybe I need to get a grip 
Cause you're the only one 
That makes me feel like this 
So

[Chorus]
Save me I'm falling again 
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces 
In the end no matter what I do 
There's nowhere, nowhere to go 

Nowhere to go but you

Tryin' to make nothing out of something 
Promise myself I wouldn't care 
Maybe you're making me a liar cause I'm sitting here 
You finally crackin' my resistance 
And find a way to wear me down 

Yea, I just look at you 
And there's no way out 


Every single road I take (it's you) 
Asleep or wide awake (I know it's you) 
And it's too late for anyone to save me 

I'm falling again 
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces 

[Chorus: x2]

Nowhere to go but youOh oh oh
In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Oh oh

I looked down
And my shirt's turning red
I'm spinning around
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice
In my ear
Like I missed you
Want you tonight

[Chorus]
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Oh oh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
Oh oh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
(Soldier down) my heart

Thought I moved
More than on
Thought I could
Fool her charm
I really wanna go
But I can't leave her alone
Oh oh

Hear the sound
Of a love so loud
I just can't
I just can't
Ignore this feeling
Said she missed me
And she wants me
Wants me tonight

[Chorus]

In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest voice
A gunshot on the floor
Oh oh

[Chorus]

Straight through my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
My heart, my heart, my heart
Straight through my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
Oh ohFirst off I can't keep a promise
I'm no one to count on at all
Add on that I'm a coward
Too scared to return your call

But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger, than me
La la la la la la
'Cause you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

It's known that I'm a liar
Often I'm blacker than white
Add on my uncandid ego
No ones less humbled than I

But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger, than me
La la la la la la
'Cause you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

All the messed up things I do
Yeah I swear I'll make 'em up to you
Before you're going heaven knows
Just let me make it better
I'll try and measure up
I'll try and measure up to you
Oh yeah,

I'll make 'em up to you
Oh yeah!

But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger, than me
La la la la la la
'Cause you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Just bigger than me
La la la la la la
La la la la la laYeah, yeah, oh,
Yeah, yeah,

You should be right here laying next to me
But baby you chose to love the hard way
You could be right here getting the best of me
But baby you decided he was your man

And now that you're finding out
He's playing little games, you calling me again
You say you want me around
But I'm not sure now if I wanna be down
So

I think I wanna stay single
Maybe we're better apart
See I don't want a girl
That, only wanna come back
'Cause, some other man broke her heart

So bye bye love
Bye love
So bye bye love (Bye love)
Bye love

It wasn't long ago that you turned your back, no.
Saying there's no way that we can work (We can work)
And you were quick to move on to the next thing

And now that you're finding out
He's playing little games, you calling me again

You need love (you need love)Life should be like a game of cards
You make a mistake
Shuffle the deck and start over
It should be just like drivin' in your car
Get lost and your navigation system
Gets you closer

But there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
Cause once you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back
Letting you go

If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this bed
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now

Wish I come with  remote controls
Then I just rewind into
The time it was better
It should have a restart button
So, I could travel right back
To the day that I met her

But there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
Cause when you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back
Letting you go

If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this bed
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now

Oh, oh, oh yeah
Cause there ain't no handbook (handbook)
You're on your own (your own)
Got no instructions (instructions)
When it comes to love (to love)
See once you do something (you do)
Can't be undone (undone)
Wish I could take back
Letting you go

If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this bed
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)

Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know nowGot a million reasons to run and hide
I don't blame you for being scared (for being scared, no)
'Bout a novel long, all the pain that he's caused you

Baby I'm fully aware (I'm fully aware)
If I could change the stories ending to me and you
Don't know the meaning of pretending what to do

[Chorus]
I could be the one
Give you all my love
Forget what he has done to you
I'm here now
Open up to me
Love will set you free
If ever you believe then 
Please believe in me
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
Let the world know baby
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
Let the world know baby, this is us

I know everything isn't meant to last
Box up all those photographs
Your moving on, yeah
I could flip back over that hour glass
And refill the better half (the better half)

And it's a miracle how broken hearts can mend
Won't you dry up all those tear drops and start again

[Chorus]

If I could show you there's no risk of being left alone
Would you let your past go
I'll take it slow
'Cause there's no need to rush when I knowIntimacy's
Fresh from my dreams
Over a triple X movie screen
I couldn't care less about being seen
A higher self esteem if you're on me?
(Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)
I say baby do you think
Sugar so sweet should rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me
Spoiled crazy

I said,
Public display of affection
(Gotta make 'em)
Pointing in that direction
(Watch me, watch me)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your P-D-A hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)
Your P-D-A, hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)
Your P-D-A hey hey

Remember at the beach we brought the sheets
We were harassed by police
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we be the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense can be intense
It's got me convinced, oh yeah
You're the fingers to my instrument

Public display of affection
(Gotta make 'em)
Pointing in that direction
(Watch me, watch me)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty

And we're so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navho
(Hmm, nasty)
And we're so compatible

We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly

(That's right)
Public display of affection
Mmm I want your PDAThis scenes so hypnotic
Smoking mirrors, lights and magic
Paper faces in gold
There's solider boys, beauty queens
Everyone's a mystery
It's got me losing control

Yearning, I'm yearning for the one to steal my eyes
Wanna play in this game of disguise 

It's a masquerade, a love parade
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All though the night and day
My masquerade, I need you baby
So stay with me tonight

Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade

Just like a perfect dream
I don't ever wanna leave
A thousand freaks in the show
One's a tiger, one's a lynx
One's a king that suffering
Moving high, moving love

Burning, I'm burning, can't you see it in my eyes?
Wanna play in this game of disguise 

It's a masquerade, a love parade
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All though the night and day
My masquerade, I need you baby
So stay with me tonight

Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade

I gotta know the girl behind the mask
Let me in, where you been, don't pretend
Dreamed that I had her alone
Show your face to me, we could be everything

It's a masquerade, a love parade
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All though the night and day
My masquerade, I need you baby
So stay with me tonight

A masquerade, a love parade
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All though the night and day
My masquerade, I need you baby
So stay with me tonight

Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masqueradeOh
Oh
Oh oh oh yeah
Oh no
Yeah

Shorty ain't got cable,
She ain't even got a radio, way more than able.
What kinda girl should I take her for?
The perfect kind, just what I like,
Exactly what I had in my mind, a dream
She's a dream, yeah

Shorty don't know I'm on the red carpet, almost every night.
And when I'm outta town to go and do work,
I'm first class every flight.
If she takes the time to open her eyes,
She can realize that she's a dream
'Cause she knows me

'Cause Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.
But Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me
That's why I make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah
Make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah

Shorty don't know who I am

And I'm cool with that, if she says so
I ain't even got a lot to her
And when I'm out making pesos?
Ain't' nobody treat her like I do her.
'Cause I'm the one that she thinks about,
The only one on her mind,
She's a dream
'Cause she knows me
And Shorty don't know that I'm on the stage,
Like three or four times a week
She don't even know I've been around the world
And all the different girls I meet.
But there's just one, face that I see
She's the only one for me
She's a dream
'Cause she knows me

'Cuase Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me
That's why I make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah
Make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah
(She's a dream)

See, shorty don't know who I am
That's not good for us, 'cause I know,
It's not good to fuss
And I know she loves me, for me
And I love her, for her
But It wouldn't work if she ever gave
A damn 'bout who I am but she knows me

She don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me
Oh,
Make her say, ah
Make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah

'Bout me
(She's a dream)So empty, can't feel no more,
As I'm left with my tears on the floor
I wait for my heart to mend,
But you keep tearing a hole

Inside, I'm so lost,
In the middle of my heart
It's a battlefield of love,
I've been fighting for too long

And now I'm shattered,
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(But it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

What am I still here for,
Could it be that I'm just waiting
Hoping you'd rescue me,
And put the pieces together again

Inside, I'm so lost,
In the middle of my heart
It's a battlefield of love,
I've been fighting for too long

And now I'm shattered
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(But it slipped from you hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

Tell me what you're really here for,
If you never really loved me
I gave my all but it still wasn't enough

Cause all you had to say was that you ain't
Looking for commitment
Instead of telling me what I wanted to hear, hey

You took my emotions
And scattered them on the ground
So hard to just pick up,
And move on with life, again

And now I'm shattered
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(But it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

Can't believe, you and me, ahhYour words burn, they're melting
What we have, I'm breaking down
No reason, no warning, no love loss
You might as well

Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
Take our memories, throw them all aside
I hope you finally get what you want
Now you know

I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love without ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

I can't feel without ya
You know I can't deal without ya
And now I got a life without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

And this constant echoing
In my head,
I'm spinning 'round
You seem so unaffected
While I go on in this hell

Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
Take our memories, throw them all aside
I hope you finally get what you want
Now you know

I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love without ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

I can't feel without ya
You know I can't deal without ya
And now I got a life without ya
And it's killing me
That we can be undone

We can be undone

You're talking now
And I'm hearin' everything that you say
And I'm holding on is a real phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave
It's dragging me to my grave

You're talking now
And I'm hearin' everything that you say
And I'm holding on is a real phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave

I didn't wanna live without ya

I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

I can't feel without you, 
You know I can't deal without you
And now I got a life without you, and it's killing me
That we could be undone

I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love with ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me

You know we're worlds apart, yeah I've got to let you know

You are the piece I can't replace, oh
You left a mark that won't erase, no

No one else can teach me how to love again
'Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it
Nevermind what people say 'cause they don't understand
How you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it

Some try to break through the walls
I've built up but they don't compare to you
One chance, I swear I'll never let you go

You left a mark that won't erase, no

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling itThe roses you left me slowly fading to grey
Your coat on the chair and the scent of your hair I miss
The clock on the wall it reminds me of all the better times
When we walked in the park and we whispered in the dark
Yeah we laughed and cried

And I never knew alone wherever you are is home

Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe

Ooh I walked by the store where we sat on the floor and we ate like kings
And someone said hey we're locking the door no time to play

And I never knew alone wherever you are is home

Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe

We're not over
We're not over

Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine
And no I can't
You know I can't breathe

Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breatheMadeleine
What's up with those tears in your eyes
What happened when you shut down,
And all the amber lights turned into red
In the silence of your cave, you feel safe
You decorate it with velvet drapes
Outside you see the dark woods
But you don't know there's fields of gold ahead

Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, you'll know
Help is on its way

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise up little girl
'Cause only you can Madeleine

Oh Madeleine

Remember when we used to sit and watch from the bridge
And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what they would find out
You wrote it in a notebook
And said someday that this would be a story to tell
And you'd put it in a movie, maybe be the movie star
Something stole your tears and wiped your smile away

Hold on, don't let go
Hold on and you'll know
Help is on its way

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise up little girl
'Cause only you can Madeleine

Let the sunshine warm your heart today
So rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise up little girl
'Cause only you can Madeleine

Oh Madeleine
Oh MadeleineI've seen it all a thousand times
Falling down I'm still alive, am I? Am I?
So hard to breathe when the water's high
No need to swim I'll learn to fly, so high, so high
You find the truth in a child's eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you

When walls starts to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show 'em what you're made of
When sun light is fading
The world will be waiting for you
Just show 'em what you're made of

Gloves are off, ready to fight
Like a lion I will survive.
Will I? Will I?

Something that you said got into my head
Here I am falling from the edge
Waiting for the day I can run away with you with you
Like angels on fire we burn the sky
One kiss and we say goodbye

If we could only make believe
You and me together
We could be king and queen
Rule another world forever
We'd set our course to live or die
Across the universe
I'd be by your side
If we could only believe
We can only make believe
We could only make believe

Catch another breath I got nothing left
This love I have is pulling me to death
Waiting for the night I can feel alive with you
Like angels on fire we burn the sky
One kiss and we say goodbye

If we could only make believe
You and me together
We could be king and queen
Rule another world forever
We'd set our course to live or die
Across the universe
I'd be by your side
If we could only believe
We can only make believe
We could only make believe

If we close our eyes
Let our hearts collide
Leave the world outside
Leave it all behind

Is it too much to ask for
One minute to breath
Cause you take my breath away
Like I'd never sink

You're the reason why cave men drew on the walls
The reason why after every summer we fall

You're the reason I never wanna sleep at night

How beautiful you are in me

You're the reason why cave men drew on the wall
Why after every summer we fall

It's almost a year since
I got to hold you, head on my shoulder
Dodging the daylight, taking the blame I
It's all I got left, so lately I've spent

Every single night like its 25 to life
And this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven
And I'm guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart
But even I've got rights, you're always gonna be my

Always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
'Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call

First time it rings
I can't help but think of the first time I saw you
That moment I knew
Holding the phone tight, I hear the tone twice
If you just pick up, swear I can fix us

Every single night feels like 25 to life
And this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven
And I'm guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart
But even I've got rights, your always gonna be my

Always be my one phone call

So let me make my case
That way you won't erase the message
That I'm leaving for you now
But if you do at least you knew

Always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call

I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home

You'll always be my one phone callBeen down the back roads
Where the girls are homegrown
That southern dame's so
Sexy how they talk slow
And something happens in the woods of Kentucky
Drinking moonshine, bon fire, pour the gasoline

Farther south, where the sweet tequila flows
Tiny clothes, Yo te amo, México
Señoritas, we are sippin' margaritas on the beach
They got something you can't teach

I've been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo,
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home

Rock out in Bangkok, where the party, don't stop
Eyes open, blood shot
Seeing things I'd never thought
Sweatin' in the heat
God I love the way they speak
Burning up the streets, dancing like a freak

I've been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo,
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home

So many things to see
So many eyes to meet
I couldn't count them all if I had eternity
So I just want you to know
Everywhere that I go
You take a piece of me

Beijing, Stockholm, Buenos Aires, to tango
Moscow, Cape Town, showed us how to get down
London, Berlin, this is where it all began
San Juan, Sydney, can't forget the NYC

I've been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo,
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like homeWanna be there just in time
Wanna be your shining knight
Protect you like a soldier

I wanna be the first in line
Be the one to save your life
All I wanna do is hold you

But somebody shot you down right in the middle of a war outside
Words mean so little when you've heard those lies
You need someone to make you believe, make you believe...oh oh oh

I will be your soldier
I, I'll stand and fight until it's over
Oh, and if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier

And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier

You don't have to hide your scars
I'll be there when you fall apart
And fix you like a soldier

You don't have to go to far
Baby just lay down your arms
Now that the battle's over

But somebody shot you down right in the middle of a war outside

Quit playin' games with my heart

To keep you comin' back to me
Everything I do is for you

Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

You've got something so that incredible in my eyes, 
My heart (my heart) is stars to bumpin' whenever you around 
My whole world upside down baby 
But I try to get closer and you always push me away 
You tell me its much too soon, but I just can't help it 
I've always got to make a play 

[Chorus]

All my senses, going around you all the time 
And I invences, I've never going hope 
Always gotta lose control

And I can't hold on any more, my body's callin' for ya 
So please don't hesitate 

[Chorus]

Go

I hear ya saying, that you think that we should wait 
And I can't hold on any more, my body's callin' for ya 
So please don't hesitate 
My body's callin' for ya 
So please don't hesitate 

[Chorus]This is for the lovers, 
Strictly for the lovers, year 
If you want some one you want to get close to, 
Then you get close to this 

Woo, just to be close to ya 

Yo, drop the verse 

Like a flower to a tree, that how close I want to be, 
To your heart (baby to your heart, heart) 
Like the stars to the night, and daytime is to light 
Will never part (will never part) 
I want you to be the only thing that I see 
'cause I believe it's our destiny 

[Chorus]
Just to be close, just to be close 
It's the only thing that I want to do 
Just to be close, just to be close 
Just to be close to ya (closer to ya) 
Just to be close 

So lonely is the night, without you to hold me tight 
(I want to hold ya closer) 
I need ya (baby hold me closer, closer) 
My life will mean nothing without the joy you bring 
To me, you know, you know, you know 
There were never (never be) no one else for me 
You were like the dream that become reality 

[Chorus] 

I want to give you all my love (all my love)

And everything I do
I want to be with youListen girl, I don't know where to start 
'Cause every word I say is straight from the heart 
I've been so wrong, I've never meant to hurt you 
Oh girl, I'm sorry of what I put you through 
Girl I'd do anything for one more chance
'Cause I want you back again 

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I see 

You and I we shared enough together 
Each other was all we'd ever need 
I thought that you would stay with me forever 
But I took for granted the love you gave to me 
But I'll keep on trying, till the end 
Baby I need you back with me 
I need you back

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I see 

And girl I'm going out of my mind 
I miss ya so much, I don't know what to do 
Please say its just a matter of time, 
Until I feel your touch, 
Until you let me come back to you 

I think about you girl every time at night 
I'm in love, and it feels so right 
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain 
I was just caught up in the lying game 
But now those days are over, I've changed my ways 
Now I'm counting the minutes, I'm counting the days 
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start 
To find a new way to get back into your heart 

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face and I wonder 
When you close your eyes do you think about me? 
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other 
And every time I close my eyes 
You're all that I seeBaby, can I talk to you?
I know something's wrong
Things just ain't the same
But deep down inside
I know you still care
So tell me what to do
To get things back
The way they used to be

If your words had meaning
If you really cared about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart
If you were my lover
A constant friend to me
Tell me why
Would you turn away from my love

I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't know)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (yeah)
As long as you love me
As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did (yeah)
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love meI don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know
But if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine!

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

To you, hey girl
Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
I Love You

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you
My love is all I have to give

My love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you

I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you[Chorus]
Oh baby I'm missing you 
We used the love so strong 
Tell me where do we go 
Oh baby I'm missing you 
They said I'd learn to forget but it sure ain't happen yet 

Been checkin' out the places where we used to go 
Been lookin' for your face inside the crowd 
I've been talkin' to the people what we used to know 
Nobody wants to say where you hang out

And when I call your phone 
Seems like you're never home 
And you don't return my call 
It tears me apart 
This is breakin' up my heart 

[Chorus]

I still have your pictures hung around my room 
That's the only thing that is left of you with me 
Girl what can I do to make you come back soon
And make it just the way it used to be

Oh, this is someone new 
Can never go on without you 
Girl I don't want to think about it 
I can't sleep at night 
No this can't be right 
Come back into my life 
(Come back baby come back) 

[Chorus]

I know there's a chance for you and I 
And I believe there's no way our love could die 
So no matter how long it takes I'll wait for you 
And what ever it takes I'll be there for you 
I'll be there, I'll be there 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]Hey, yeah
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
That's the way I like it
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)

Somebody told me that you're not my kind
So have I lost my mind? (That's the way I like it)
You keep on doing all the things I like
You've got me hypnotized
But that's the way I like it

Girl you make me wanna move
It's the price I got to pay
For all the things you do
But I like it
You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

Oh, mystery lady, you've got somethin' I like
Tell me you're here to stay (ooh yeah)
You're dangerous, oh baby
Could you do me right?
Will you come out to play?
'Cause that's the way I like it

Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on

Everybody come on

Everybody come on

You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
Hey, yeah!

That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it (everybody now)
That is the way I like it (everybody now)

(That's the way that, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)
(That's the way)Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh, what a life
Once we were dreamers just dreamers we were
Oh, you and I
Now I see you're just somebody who wastes all my time and money
What a lie, you and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

Once I could handle the truth
When the truth was you and I
But time after time all the
Promises turned out to be all lies
Now I see I'm just somebody who wasted my time and money
What a lie (what a lie, what a lie, oh)
You and I

What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

You said "I'll take you back"
But I closed the door 'cause I don't want
10,000 more
Oh

10,000 promises yeah (oh)
10,000 promises you gave to me

Repeat chorus
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me (That you gave to me)
What about your 10,000 promises?
You gave to me
Once we were lovers just lovers we were
Oh you and I
What a lieIf I could right the wrongs that made you cry 
I make a promise not to say good-night
"Cause I'm holding on 
With a love so strong
And I can't take a day without you by my side

Girl if i could change
If I could change your mind
Baby you could  help me wipe these tears from my eyes

[Chorus]
Girl don't stop
The sun from shining down on me 
'Cause  I can't face another day without your smile
And if you take away the love and arms that surround me 
The I might break down and cry just like a child

Girl,I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me
So I'm pressin' on
I hope you understand
There's a broken heart that lies inside your hands

So if I could change 
And it won't hurt your pride
Baby you could help me stop these tears that I cry

[Chorus]

Like a child 
Just like a child
With the spirits running free 
She showed my why
Oh, she did

Like a child(oh baby)
Just like a child
Think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
Like a child

[Chorus]do, da da da da
do, da da da da
do, da da da da

The candle plays the hourglass
Days go and all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
Every smile even all the reasons why
You say I pushed you out of my life

Chorus
Baby you set me (ha-ha-ahhh)
Baby you set me (do da da da da)
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you set me 
Set adrift on memory bliss

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with 
The biggest empty void 
I've ever had in life (ever had in life)
Bet you say that I don't care
Bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there 
when the mornin comes
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life)
Baby will you be there
When I open my eyes
After all the time I've spent 
Wishing you

Chorus

Sadness has overwhelmed me
my mind flies carelessly 
I Imagine that you're happy 
With your life right now
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things
That I could never have

Chorus to fade
The candle plays the hourglass
The days go and all I do is
Think of you and wonder where you are at night
Oh I remember everything
Every smile, and even all
The reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my life

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life (ever had in life) ohh
Bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there when the morning comes?
(Baby will you be there?)
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life, baby)
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes?
After all the time I've spent, wishing you

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind flies and carelessly
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now oh
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things that I can never have

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

So come on now
I know this much is true
I know this much is trueThere are people who say what you want to hear 
Even on a rainy day they'll tell you the sky is clear 
When you really, really love someone 
And I'm right when I say that you want them near 
And if you can't even tell 
Them things that they want to hear 

[Chorus]
Always forever, all the things she said 
Never say never, those simple lies that she fed 
I will never leave you 
All the love I thought she had 
But can you blame me, no, 
'Cause that's what she said 
That's what she said 
She told me we'd see forever 
That's what she said, she said, yeah 

And,
There are people who that say what they really mean 
She said she'd always be there 
She said she'd always care 
But just when you think that you can trust that someone ya love 
Tell me why do you know 
How stars can fall from above 

[Chorus]

'Cause you made promises that you couldn't keep 
But you're not hurting' yourself 
But you're only hurting me (you're only hurting me) 
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean 
Oh how can I make you see just-a what you did to me 

Oh, you said how much you really cared 
Just when I thought I was in love 
Girl, how could you dare 
If I were you I wouldn't lie not even-a once 
To the face of the one that I love so much 

[Chorus]

Oh that's what she saidIf you want it to be good girl

You know I'd go
out of my mind
If you ever left
my heart behind

Bring your sweet love back to me

If I don't have youI may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger
That makes you larger
That makes you larger than lifeYeah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say

From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance

That deep down inside of me

You are my fire
The one desire
You are (you are, you are, you are)

'Cause I want it that wayShow me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze upon me
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be
You're asking me
To feel the things you never show

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are (where you are)

(Hey yeah)

You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture
On the Backstreet's Back, alright
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed baby
But I should have known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with
Don't, don't want you back

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I, I don't want you back

You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go

That I could control this
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you, baby
Girl if only I knew what I've done
You know, so why don't you tell me
And I, I would bring down the moon and the sun
To show how much I care

Don't want to lose you now
Baby, I know we can win this
Don't want to lose you now
No no, or ever again

I've got this feeling you're not gonna stay
It's burning within me
The fear of losing
Of slipping away
It just keeps getting closer, baby
Whatever reason to leave that I've had
My place was always beside you
And I wish that I didn't need you so bad
Your face just won't go away

Don't want to lose you now

If I wasn't such a fool

There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
Baby if I only knew

The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart

To get to you
And find a way back to your heart

I don't know how it got so crazy
But I'll do anything to set things right
'Cause your love is so amazing
Baby you're the best thing in my life

If only you would tell me girl

The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart

Give me one more chance (give me one more chance), to give my love to you (give my love, my love)
'Cause no one on this earth loves you like I do
Tell me

The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart

I turn back time
To make you mine

The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart (back to your heart)Here we are in the arms of one another
And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong and love is right
For us tonight

When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

Let it be (let it be) if we're nothing more than dreamers
Who believe (who believe) that we see no wall between us
How can they be in my heart (in my heart) and in my mind (in my mind)
When all I could find

When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

I loved you from a distance
Thought I couldn't reach that far
I can't believe how close that we are (believe how close we are, ooh ooh)
When I look into your Spanish eyes
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes (ooh yeah)When we turn out the lights
The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
But girl you know that I would never
Ever let another's touch
Come between the two of us

'Cause no one else will ever take your place

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder
You're my dream come true, oh yeah
Girl you know I'll always treasure
Every kiss and everyday 
I'll love you girl in every way
And I always will, 'cause in my eyes

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much

(Girl can't you see that) No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally, babe
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

No one else comes close
Oh girl, oh oh
No one else comes closeIt takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I want to thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
Be the perfect son

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

You showed me how to love (you showed me how to love)
You showed me how to care (you showed me how to care)
You showed me that you would
Always be there
I want to thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine

You showed me (you showed me)
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

'Cause mom you always were
Mom you always were
Mom you always were
You know you always were
'Cause mom you always were, the perfect fan

I love you mom"Hello"
"Hi, it's me, what's up, baby?
I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight
So don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"Say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really dropping out
I think my battery must be low
Listen, if you can hear me
We're going to a place nearby, alright?
Gotta go!"

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should've said, "No, someone's waiting for me"
But I called my girl up and said

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Listen, baby, I'm sorry (hello?)
Listen, baby, I'm sorry (hello?)
Gotta go

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
Gotta go

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya, don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"Yeah, yeah

Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become, oh yeah

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful, loneliness that's tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (trying)
I played my part, kept you in the dark (in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark (keep you in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (trying to be someone)
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart (now let me show you the shape of my heart)
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone 
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of

Show you the shape of my heartBackstreet
Check it uh
Hey

Let's talk about one, baby
You gotta hear me out
Did you really think I'd be the last to know
What it's all about

Let's talk about you
You say 
He's the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't want to know

I'm tellin' you he'll eat you up from inside
And then he doesn't want to know

[Chorus]
Listen I mean it
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another player
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

Let's talk about what he's done (he's done)
To become your number one
Or was it all the promises of diamonds, pearls and party dresses
That turn you on
I've seen it before (dont take!)
Anymore, free too
You're through for sure
Just go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up
I'm tellin' you to go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up

Listen I mean it (I mean it)
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another player (player)
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end (must come to an end)
Get another boyfriend

All right 
Yeah
Get another boyfriend
Stop
Hey

Hear me out
You must know (you must know)
What it's all about (baby)
That he's just a player in love (love)
This must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

[Chorus: x2][Chorus]
You're my shining star
That is what you are
There is no one like you baby
Angels everywhere
Every time you're near
You will always be my baby

Baby when you do the things you do
I want to be close to you
Cause I need to feel your every move, oh
Baby I can never say how much
I need your touch, I can't get enough
Cause you know what to do to turn me on, yeah

[Chorus]

Baby you're as close as close can get
And baby you know I'd let
Every single part of me be yours, ooh yeah
It doesn't matter if the phone might ring
Cause I won't hear a thing when I'm in your arms
Cause you know what to do to turn me on

[Chorus]

I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
Cause you are doing everything so right
Oh, oh baby
I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
Cause you are doing everything so right
Oh, oh baby

[Chorus]

You know that I adore you
want to be there everyday for you
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby
You know that I adore you
want to be there everyday for you
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby

[Chorus]It's in the silences, the words you never say
I see it in your eyes, always starts the same way
It seems like everyone we know is breaking up
Does anybody ever stay in love, anymore?

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

I see you look at me when you think I'm not aware
You're searching for clues of just how deep my feelings are
How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide?
All I know is what I feel when I look into your eyes

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything that I am

Oh, there are no guarantees
That's what you always say to me
But late at night I feel the tremble in your touch
But what I'm trying to say to you
I've never said to anyone

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

You're everything I am
With everything I am
You see me sitting here
A smile upon my face
The time has come but you know that it's not too late
There's been too many things
Together we have seen
It's not that hard if we start to believe
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

This world is not at ease
We seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only so much we can really do
It's up to you and me
To fix our destiny
The jury's here, so let's take the stand
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

So tell me why we have to cry (and not try)
When there's so many things we can do
To help this troubled world start anew

I need a reason, I need a sign
There's no turning back, I'm here by your side
Is it today or maybe tonight, we'll find
The answer to our life

Show me the way
Give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today, is it tonight
The answer to our life

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our lifeWe've been through days of thunder
Some people say we don't belong
They try to pull us under
But here we stand together in the new year strong

Let's get on with the show
(Let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are
And this one goes out to

[Chorus]
Everyone (yeah) , everyone, everyone
This one goes out to you,
Everyone
We're standing stronger 'cause' of what you've done
This one goes out to you

We've been inside the circus
We take the pleasure with the pain
I guess there's something about us
Whatever comes around will always stay the same
Oh yeah 

Let's get on with the show
(Oh let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are 
(we know who you are)

[Chorus]

Now we're minutes away
Till it's time to play
Our heartbeats are rising
They're letting you in
Time for the show to begin

Here
We're standing stronger from what you've done
This one goes out to you, you, you
You make us feel like we've just begun
And this one goes out to you... yeah

[Chorus: x2]I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
What's the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong
I heard him promise you forever
But forever's come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines, oh

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than that

Baby, you deserve much better
What's the use in holding on
Don't you see it's now or never
'Cause I just can't be friends
Baby knowing in the end, that

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

There's not a day that passes by
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
It's not too late to change your mind
So take my hand, don't say goodbye

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than that

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

I will love you more than thatI know that I
I can't believe
Just what the path has brought me
To the man I want to be
And I know that we
Have had some times
That we can't forget the struggle
Cause we have so far to go

I know we have changed
But change can be so good
So lets not forget why it's understood
That

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through
Time (time)
Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)
Time
(goes on and on) Goes on and on everyday
Baby time is what is, come what may

I remember when
Mom used to say
That things are getting better
And you'll soon be on your way
Remember those days
That we would sing at the drop of a dime
Way back when nothing else mattered

I know we have changed
But change can be so good
So lets not forget why it's understood
That

Time (time)

I was looking for something
On the crime scene where you're in too deep
I found a note with his number
It's just another clue (that leads to you)

I got a little suspicious
I got a feeling that you ain't true to me
I should've known better
Than to buy your lie (your sweet disguise)

Yeah
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
that you're not for me babe

No no, uh uh
Things will never be the same again with you
No no, uh uh
Now I know what it's comin' to
No no, uh uh
'cause' if you think that it's the way
That love should be
Let me tell you it's not for me

No no

I don't want to be part of your screenplay
Just tell me
Did you rehearse on me?
Now give me the story
On baby who's to blame (maybe I am)
Caught in the middle
And I'm tired of your games of hide and seek
I'm getting a feeling
That it's time for me to leave

You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
That you're not for me babe

No no, uh uh
Things will never be the same again with you
No no, uh uh
Now I know what it's comin' to

That love should be
Let me tell you it's not for me

Yeah (yeah)
I said no no (no way)
No no, no no (whoa)

I had enough of your talk, your games
And you won't go away
Justify my reasons to say

From the bottom of my heart.
Yeah, it's true.

Yeah, it's true.
Without you I would fall apart.

It's true.Remember when
Never needed each other
The best of friends
Like sister and brother
We understood
We'd never be alone

Those days are gone
Now I want you so much
The night is long
And I need your touch
Don't know what to say
Never meant to feel this way
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

I hear your voice
And I start to tremble
Brings back the child that
I resemble

I cannot pretend
That we can still be friends
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

I want to say this right
And it has to be tonight
Just need you to know

I don't want to live this life
I don't want to say goodbye
With you I want to spend
The rest of my life

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
Everything's changed
We never knew
How did I fall in love with youEmpty spaces fill me up with hopes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me I can't find no rest
Where I'm going is anybody's guess

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't want to make you face this world alone
I want to let you go

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

IncompleteLooking at your picture from when we first met
You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night

Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

All the doors are closing I'm tryin' to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day, the day you slipped away

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

That since I lost you, I lost myself
No I can't fake it, there's no one else

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to knowEverybody knows that I was such a fool to ever let go of you
And baby I was wrong
And yeah I know I said we'd be better off alone
It was time that we moved on
I know I broke your heart, I didn't mean to break your heart

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you.

I know you aren't there and you can make me wait, but I'm not gonna wait
It's the that least I could do, just to tell you face to face
I was lying to myself, now I'm dying in this hell
Girl I know you're mad
I can't blame you for being mad

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and now I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you

If you could see these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
Hear the heart that's barely beating, you would see a different man

But baby here I am, banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
I'm begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to youHey hey hey

The sun is over the city but it's an orange day
There is reason for lookin' up but I'm feelin' down
You see, I've got to catch a plane but won't buy a ticket
'Cause its' hard to just stop when you're spinnin' around

It's a weird world, don't you know it?
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world, no matter how you roll it

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love
It's a weird world, yeah

Sent a message to a G.I. in the desert
Said thank you man for bringin' another dawn
Back here it's her and me and we're havin' our first baby
He's out there takin' 'em on

It's a weird world and I know you know it
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world, no matter how you roll it

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love

I'm closin' my eyes but I'm startin' to see
While he's lookin' at you, she's lookin' at me
The only thing it does
Is just keep me away from you

Sure, part of this place would cheer if I die
But don't let them take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile

Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way for you to decide it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love

Hey hey hey
(It's a weird world, don't you know it?)
Hey hey hey
(It's a weird world, don't you know it?)
Hey hey hey
(Oh, it's a weird world, don't you know it?)
Hey hey heyWho are you now?
Are you still the same
Or did you change somehow?
What do you do
At this very moment when I think of you?
And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
Do you remember that?

No matter how I fight it
Can't deny it
Just can't let you go

I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

Now look at me
Instead of moving on, I refuse to see
That I keep coming back
And I'm stuck in a moment
That wasn't meant to last (to last)

I've tried to fight it
Can't deny it
You don't even know

That I still need you

Julie was a long way from home
She can make alone look pretty
Her attitude made a part of her landscape
Riding her bike through alphabet city

She likes to party in the backseat, under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise
She said "what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
She can lick her lips and smile and make you want to believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl
(Right now right now ooh ooh ooh)

Julie likes to shop lift in stores
Right alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stop
And make love on the floor until the camera made us

And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire
When she walked, I followed, when she laughed, I cried,
"What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
And I was wrapped around her finger, and I began to believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Tell me what you want from me
I've got everything you need
It's getting hard for me to breathe
Let me be your guarantee

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (a game)
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day (by day)
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl (poster girl)

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (just a game)
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Right now, right now
Right now, oh oh oh
Poster girl
Poster girl
Come on, come onOh, no

Take what you need 'cause I can't hold my breath
Say what you feel 'cause I've got nothing left, oh
I made a promise to myself last night
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

It wouldn't matter anyway, don't change a thing
You're perfect as you are, time has a way, time is all I've got
If my heart should shatter watching you
There'd be one less thing I'd have to prove

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

Heaven will be waiting when I fall into your lovely arms
I believe you'll find me there
You'll find me there

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'd take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

And if I lose it all, there'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall 'cause knowing you are out there
Breathing is so wonderful, it's a chance I'll take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all

Wouldn't matter, anywayClose your eyes, make a wish
That this could last forever
If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now

Yeah, it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

Take my hand, take my life
Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain kept inside, yeah
There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now

Yeah, it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

It's an illusion
How can I feel this way if I can't have you?
It's an illusion
Nothing is real this way if I can't have you

No, I can't let you go, you're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
(I don't wanna know)
And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
(I'm climbing the walls)
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss you

I can't let you go, no

And I don't wanna know the reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss, I miss youNo no baby 
How can I begin to tell you 
What you do to me every time I hear ya 
More willing to want to see ya 
I know that there's no use in 
Tryin' to explain the confusion 
But still I'm not complainin' 
'Bout my situation 
Let's not talk about a possible ending 

The very first time that I 
was lookin' to be your fella 
I found my inspiration 
hidin' in your expression 
So I put myself on forward 
for your consideration 

[Chorus]
Let's not talk about a possible ending 
Let's not think about it every day 
And I know I'm so in love with you 
I'm finding it harder and harder to breathe 
Every time I'm near a beautiful woman 

And so we put the top down 
To take you drivin' downtown 
I guess we'll know just what to do 
When you're lookin' to fool around 
It's too late to stop me 
I know we're gonna get down, get down, oh no 

[Chorus] 

My beautiful woman 
My beautiful woman 
Yes you are, yes you are 
My beautiful woman 
Anything that you want me to, I'll do 
My beautiful

be	 is for beautiful as the sunshine 
E tells me everything's feelin' alright 
A goes to you and me swingin' it down 
T is two, I want you 
You've got me actin' like a fool 

[Chorus: x2]

My beautiful woman 
My beautiful woman 
Yes you are, yes you are 
My beautiful woman 
You're so beautiful 
My beautiful woman 
My beautiful womanYeah, yeah 
It seems like yesterday when I said "I do" 
And after all this time my heart still burns for you 
If you don't know by now that you're my only one 
Take a look inside me and watch my heartstrings come undone 

I know I promised you forever 
Is there no stronger word I can use 
To reassure you when the storm is raging outside 
You're my safest place to hide 

Can you see me, here I am 
I need you like I needed you then 
When I feel like giving up 
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine 
You're my safest place to hide 

You see colors no one else can see 
In every breath you hear a symphony 
You understand me like nobody can 
I feel like my soul unfolding like a flower blooming 

When this whole world gets too crazy 
And there's nowhere left to go 
I know you give me sanctuary 
You're the only truth I know 
You're the road back home 

Can you see me, here I am 
Standing here where I've always been 
And when words are not enough 
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine 
You're my safest place to hide 
My safest place to hide 

I know I promised you forever 
There's no stronger word I can use 
To reassure when the storm is raging outside 
You're my safest place to hide 

Oh! Can you see me, here I am 
Standing here where I've always been 
When I feel like giving up 
I promise inside your heart I'd still find 
Yeah, yeah 
You're my safest place to hide, oh yeah 
You're my safest place to hideWhen you come back I won't be here
She said and gently pulled me near
If you want to talk you can call
I know it's not your fault

I just smiled and said let go of me
But there's something that I've just gotta know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said it's not my fault

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been

Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head

When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too
When the one that you want doesn't want you

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the life to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

Siberia, Siberia
When the one you want doesn't want you tooI really miss you
There's something that I gotta say

The things we did,
the things we said,
Keep coming back to me and make me smile again.
You showed me how to face the truth.
Everything that's good in me, I owe to you.

Though the distance that's between us now, may seem to be too far.
It will never separate us, deep inside I know you are

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)
Never Gone

No, no, no

I walk along these empty streets.
There is not a second you're not here with me.
The love you gave, the grace you've shown,
Will always give me strength and be my corner stone.
Some how you found a way to see the best I have in me.
As long as time goes on, I swear to you that you will be

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)

Never gone from me
If there's one thing I believe
I believe
I will see you somewhere down the road again.

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)
Never Gone

Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)
Never GoneLast night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
Sunday afternoonWalking along the sky
Chasing a glimpse of you
Painting a world with stars I found inside your eyes
Up here above the haze
Everything looks so clear
Wondering what it would be like if you were here

And time takes time ([Howie:] takes time)
But I can't wait
To tell you how I feel

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

I hold you close when it all goes crazy
And through it all, you'll be my lady
Why, tell me why
You're everything
Everything but mine

You don't have to be afraid
Of somebody else's touch
Just gimme a chance to prove
Just how you should be loved

And time, it takes time ([Howie:] takes time)
It's not too late
To tell you how I feel

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

Everything but mine
Mine I know, oh baby
Someday you'll come around
I'm gonna leave the light on
And I won't let you down
No I won't let you down

I won't let you down

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

You're everything but mine
You're everything but mine
You're the sun, you're the star
You're the moon, you're the rain
Love your lips, love your eyes
Drivin' me insane, oh baby, baby
Everything but mine
You're everything but mineI close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I wanna let you walk away tonight without a word

I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling
Oh, if you were here right now,
I swear I'd tell you this

Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin it inside, it's killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

I climb the walls, yeah
I can see the edge,
But I can't take the fall, no
I've memorized the number
So why can't I make the call
Maybe 'cause I know you'll always be with me
In the possibility

Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin it inside, it's killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

No, no, no

I don't wanna be like this
I just wanna let you know
That everything I hold in
Is everything I can't let go (oh, can't let go)

'Cause

Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin it inside, it's killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

Don't you know it baby
I don't wanna waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'm inconsolable
Whoa yeah
I'm inconsolableHere we are, seven days
And seven nights of empty tries
It's ritual, habitual
But it's never gonna work this time

We're to the point of no return
And along the way the only thing we've learned
Is how to hurt each other

I'm looking back and wondering why
It took so long to realize
That nothing's changed, it never will
All these years of standing still
And still we stay in all this pain
And nothing's gonna make it go away

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know

So save your voice
Don't waste your breath
Can't you see we're at the end
And this goodbye is permanent
So wish me well and try to forget

And all the fights
And all the ways
We almost made it
But we never did
And it's finally come to this

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know

We can not hide what we've become
So sick and tired of being numb
It's done, it's done
It's done

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No, you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
'Cause I know, I know, I know
'Cause I know, 'cause I knowShe keeps her secrets
In her eyes
She wraps the truth
Inside her lies
Just when I can't say
What she's done to me
She comes to me
And leads me back to paradise

She's so hard to hold
But I can't let go

I'm a house of cards
In a hurricane
A reckless ride
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She tears away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles

Oh when she smiles

Maybe I'd fight if I could
It hurts so bad
But feels so good
She opens up just like
A rose to me
When she's close to me
Anything she'd ask me to
I would

It's out of control
But I can't let go

I'm a house of cards
In a hurricane
A reckless ride
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She tears away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles

When she looks at me
I get so weak

I'm a house of cards
In a hurricane
A reckless ride
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She tears away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles[Nick:]
There you go caught you crashin' my dreams again
Just when I'm trying to get over you
I tell my heart but I can't seem to comprehend
A day without you

[AJ:]
Now you've carved out a life
But I wear the scars
Reminding me by the hour
That it's time to accept that's the way the things are
I wish I could but

[Chorus:]
I can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why it can't be any other way
Any other way

[Brian:]
Since you drained all the color out of the sky
How am I supposed to feel?
It's like I'm livin' in somebody else's life
Tell me it's not real

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

[Howie:]
Like we never had a falling out
Like the tears had never hit the ground
Like you're still here
You're still here

[Brian:]
Since you drained all the color out of the sky

[Repeat Chorus 2x][AJ/Nick:]
She wakes up with the sun
She throws on her clothes
Hoping her car will start
The second time around
The day has begun
The line's out the door
Serving up fraps
Until she can't take anymore
I see it in her broken smile
Oh why

[Chorus:]
Wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way

[Howie/Nick:]
No she never looks my way
She never, never, ever looks my way
She ties up her hair
Her makeup is smeared
Wiping the tears that she wants no one to see
She screams on the pain
I hear every word
Why don't you know how beautiful you are
Just see it in my broken smile

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Brian/Howie:]
If I could be the light
To guide you through the darkness baby
If I could be the one
To change the ending to your story
I'd be one in a million
I'd be one in a million
Someday I will tell her
You're gonna work it out somedayStop it, stop it
Stop it, stop it
Go, stop and go
I just hit static
I used to read you
Loud and clear
Not like this
It's so erratic

And I'm not rational
When I see you around
Your inconsistency
And you know it's dragging me down
You're so conflicted baby

You're always walking away
One step and everything's over
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
I'm already dead
I already said (I already said) I'm sorry

Stop it
I've made mistakes
I've been an addict
A blind fanatic
Don't you know
You're not immune to the panic
With somebody

When the snow hits your skin
The cold don't last forever
But you're livin' again
If you don't let seasons change


How many times do I have to say it
Before you believe me

Stop it, stop it
Stop and go

Panic!I can see in your eyes
Broken windows, fallen skies
Baby, baby what you hidin' from
The light that followed you around
Lately nowhere to be found
Don't you know that I'm your place to run

You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know

That you can let go

Sifting through shattered dreams
Livin' in the in between
Baby, babe it's gonna be alright
(You can let go)
When you're lost, let down, disappointed
And jerked around in this cold, cold world
I will always be by your side

You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
There ain't nothin' you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know

That you can let go

Don't be afraid when you're falling apart
Don't hesitate I'll be right where you are
Open your eyes there's a crack in the dark

Never let me see you cry
You locked it somewhere deep inside
Baby, baby let me hold you tight

Make it alright

Baby, baby gonna be alright
Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you (I won't turn against you)
Not letting it show
Baby, babe gonna be alright
Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you
You can let go

You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
You can let go
There ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to knowHow come you never know
What you got until it's gone
Too bad
Because I never felt so good with anyone
How fooled was I into thinking
I was gonna be alright
Okay
Fine

So every day I try a little harder
To forget her
Lie here convince myself
Tomorrow will be better

The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of her memory
And now I know what it is
Love is what the trouble is
Love is what the trouble is

How come she said
You never wear your heart
Where I can see
Too bad
'Cause now I'm the one
Who's sorry
How stupid was I into thinking
I was gonna be alright
Okay
Fine
So everyday I find a little something
To remind me
No matter how I try
I can't put the past behind me

The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of her memory
And now I know what it is

Love has let me go
I'm alright, I'm okay
I'll be fine, give it time

But the only trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone (she's gone)
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of her memory (I just can't)
And now I know what it is (yes I do)
And now I know what it is
'Cause love is what the trouble is
The trouble
Love, love is what the trouble is[AJ:]
The first night that we met
I will never forget
Baby, you were a star
From that point in time
It was always you and I shining
So beautiful
When we're out with your friends
You treat me like I'm dead
It was like I'm invisible

[Nick:]
(I can't let it go)
That was unforgettable
(I can't let it go)
I just wanna let you know
(I can't let it go)
Situations unlivable
(I can't let it go)
I can't let it go
(I can't let it go)

[Chorus:]
Tell me what you say that you want me
All you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
Make me say oh no
I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right

[Brian:]
Oh, you got me twisted
Oh, you got me twisted
I'm not someone you can just disrespect
How would you feel if you were in my shoes
Feelin' used with your heart bruised

[Nick:]
(I can't let it go)
The situations critical
(I can't let it go)
Relationship is pitiful
(I can't let it go)
Everything's falling apart
(I can't let it go)
Cause you're so hypocritical

[Repeat Chorus]

[All:]
You're just no good for me
You're no good for me
You're just no good for me
I know you're no good for me

[Howie:]
You know
It's wrong to treat me cold
I've no one to hold
One day I'm gonna say goodbye
What's it gonna be
Girl I'm gonna leave
Unless you turn around
And treat me right

[Repeat Chorus]

[Howie:]
Just treat me right
Just treat me right

[Brian:]
Say that you want me

[Howie:]
Just treat me right
Just treat me right

[Repeat Chorus]I won't tell nobody
I'll just scream it in my mind
Nothing good in life is scripted
It's not like we predicted
That the one you want
Is gonna be the one you thought

I won't tell nobody
But I won't live like a prisoner
Nothing has to be so perfect
Can you tell me was it worth it
Because her heart can't lie
And even though her face may try
Love can keep you up all night

'Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side
Love will keep you up all night

If I don't tell a living soul
Still everyone would know
Yes they would
It's always three am somewhere
You know it when you get there

Some people try to cover it up
Some people think it's never enough (never enough)

'Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side
Love will keep you up all night

I don't mean to scare you
But everybody has a first time
One day when you're old and gray
Don't look back and never say
You should have tried
Stayed up all night

Love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide

One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone

Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side
To the other side
Love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're cryin', you're cryin'
Love will keep you up all night
You got a taste of sweet divine
It took you to the other side

Love will keep you up all night
Love will keep you up all night

Love will keep you up all night[Brian:]
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace
You could be anyone today
Maybe I would recognize you On a crowded street

[AJ:]
Maybe you'll take me by surprise
Will you be the one I had in mind

[Chorus (emphasis on AJ):]
There'll come a day
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Face to face
Like I'm imagining
Baby how can I be sure
That you're the one I'm waiting for
Will you be unmistakable

[AJ:]
Unmistakable

[Nick:]
People say we're watching our lives
Through a glass
Desperately waiting on a chance
I know you're out there
Holding on, holding out for me

[AJ:]
How are we to know the time is right
What if you're here and I'm just blind

[Repeat Chorus (emphasis on Nick)]

[Nick:]
How can I know a song I never heard
How will I know your voice
When you haven't said a word

[AJ:]
How do I know how this will end
Before we begin

[Nick:]
Before we begin

[Howie:]
There'll come a day
When you walk out of my dreams

[All:]
Face to face (face to face)
Like I'm imagining (Like I'm imagining)
Baby, how can I be sure (how can I be sure)
That you're the one I'm waiting for (You're the one I'm waiting for)
Will you be (will you be)
Will you be (will you be)

[AJ:]
Unmistakable
UnmistakableHow come I was the last to know
Took the stage then you stole the show
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
I was captured by that stare
Now I'm shattered, but I don't care
And the people walking by don't have a clue

That I kissed your face
'Til the sun was in our eyes
'Til the afternoon arrived
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

Monday is a funny thing
Still waiting for the phone to ring
Will my imagination take it slow
After Saturday, my life is changed
In a moment it was rearranged
Strange how easy it is letting go
And I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes
And now I'm running blind

And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

This sweet relief
Unexpected things
Is this the end or only the beginning

I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes
Like the afternoon
Now I'm running blind (running blind)
I can't explain (can't explain)

Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love that's made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoonI been walking around
Inside a haze
Between the lines of reason
Hiding from the ghost
Of yesterday
Feels like I'm barely breathing

I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

I've been losin days
The shades pulled down
I still can't face the sun

But I-I'm goin crazy
I can't stay here
I've gone completely numb
I just wanna need someone
I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

Oh no
I thought you were the only one girl
But now I think I was wrong
Cause life goes on
Na na na na na

I've been walking around inside a haze

Oh I,

I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

In a downpour feel the rain
Feel the rain

I wanna feel the rainSo I lay awake another hour
Just like the one before
The shadows play a game with my head
I can't take this anymore

I hear the sound
Of my own breathing
It makes me miss you more

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Just leave me here in pieces
In pieces

I can't take the chance
Of running into
You running into me
So lock the door
And close the window
I just wanna see

Until the day
Inside my future
When I'll be on my feet

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Just leave me here in pieces
In pieces

If you want you can find me
On the dark side of the sun
Babe I don't wanna see what we've become
The damage has all been done

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
Wake me up when it's over
When the damage has all been done
The damage is done
I don't wanna be somewhere
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Leave me here in pieces
Just leave me in pieces
Just leave me in pieces
Just wake me up when it's over (in pieces)
Just wake me up when it's overLooking for beauty in a certain 
Finding the strength inside a gray 
Maybe I'm heading for a breakdown 
And maybe that's ok 
Could be I'm hanging on for dear life 
Maybe I need to get a grip 
Cause you're the only one 
That makes me feel like this 
So

[Chorus]
Save me I'm falling again 
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces 
In the end no matter what I do 
There's nowhere, nowhere to go 

Nowhere to go but you

Tryin' to make nothing out of something 
Promise myself I wouldn't care 
Maybe you're making me a liar cause I'm sitting here 
You finally crackin' my resistance 
And find a way to wear me down 

Yea, I just look at you 
And there's no way out 


Every single road I take (it's you) 
Asleep or wide awake (I know it's you) 
And it's too late for anyone to save me 

I'm falling again 
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces 

[Chorus: x2]

Nowhere to go but youOh oh oh
In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Oh oh

I looked down
And my shirt's turning red
I'm spinning around
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice
In my ear
Like I missed you
Want you tonight

[Chorus]
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Oh oh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
Oh oh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
(Soldier down) my heart

Thought I moved
More than on
Thought I could
Fool her charm
I really wanna go
But I can't leave her alone
Oh oh

Hear the sound
Of a love so loud
I just can't
I just can't
Ignore this feeling
Said she missed me
And she wants me
Wants me tonight

[Chorus]

In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest voice
A gunshot on the floor
Oh oh

[Chorus]

Straight through my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
My heart, my heart, my heart
Straight through my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
(Soldier down) my heart
Oh ohFirst off I can't keep a promise
I'm no one to count on at all
Add on that I'm a coward
Too scared to return your call

But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger, than me
La la la la la la
'Cause you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

It's known that I'm a liar
Often I'm blacker than white
Add on my uncandid ego
No ones less humbled than I

But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger, than me
La la la la la la
'Cause you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

All the messed up things I do
Yeah I swear I'll make 'em up to you
Before you're going heaven knows
Just let me make it better
I'll try and measure up
I'll try and measure up to you
Oh yeah,

I'll make 'em up to you
Oh yeah!

But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger, than me
La la la la la la
'Cause you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Just bigger than me
La la la la la la
La la la la la laYeah, yeah, oh,
Yeah, yeah,

You should be right here laying next to me
But baby you chose to love the hard way
You could be right here getting the best of me

You make a mistake
Shuffle the deck and start over
It should be just like drivin' in your car
Get lost and your navigation system
Gets you closer

But there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
Cause once you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back
Letting you go

If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this bed
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now

Wish I come with  remote controls
Then I just rewind into
The time it was better
It should have a restart button
So, I could travel right back
To the day that I met her

But there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
Cause when you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back
Letting you go

If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this bed
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now

Oh, oh, oh yeah
Cause there ain't no handbook (handbook)
You're on your own (your own)
Got no instructions (instructions)
When it comes to love (to love)
See once you do something (you do)
Can't be undone (undone)
Wish I could take back
Letting you go

If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this bed
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best

What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know nowGot a million reasons to run and hide
I don't blame you for being scared (for being scared, no)
'Bout a novel long, all the pain that he's caused you

Baby I'm fully aware (I'm fully aware)
If I could change the stories ending to me and you
Don't know the meaning of pretending what to do

[Chorus]
I could be the one
Give you all my love
Forget what he has done to you
I'm here now
Open up to me
Love will set you free
If ever you believe then 
Please believe in me
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
Let the world know baby
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
Let the world know baby, this is us

I know everything isn't meant to last
Box up all those photographs
Your moving on, yeah
I could flip back over that hour glass
And refill the better half (the better half)

And it's a miracle how broken hearts can mend
Won't you dry up all those tear drops and start again

[Chorus]

If I could show you there's no risk of being left alone
Would you let your past go
I'll take it slow
'Cause there's no need to rush when I knowIntimacy's
Fresh from my dreams
Over a triple X movie screen
I couldn't care less about being seen
A higher self esteem if you're on me?
(Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)
I say baby do you think
Sugar so sweet should rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me
Spoiled crazy

I said,
Public display of affection
(Gotta make 'em)
Pointing in that direction
(Watch me, watch me)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your P-D-A hey hey

Your P-D-A, hey hey

Remember at the beach we brought the sheets
We were harassed by police
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we be the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense can be intense
It's got me convinced, oh yeah
You're the fingers to my instrument

Public display of affection
(Gotta make 'em)
Pointing in that direction
(Watch me, watch me)
Public display of affection

Public display of affection
Mmm I want your PDAThis scenes so hypnotic
Smoking mirrors, lights and magic
Paper faces in gold
There's solider boys, beauty queens
Everyone's a mystery
It's got me losing control

Yearning, I'm yearning for the one to steal my eyes
Wanna play in this game of disguise 

It's a masquerade, a love parade
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All though the night and day
My masquerade, I need you baby
So stay with me tonight

Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade

Just like a perfect dream
I don't ever wanna leave
A thousand freaks in the show
One's a tiger, one's a lynx
One's a king that suffering
Moving high, moving love

Burning, I'm burning, can't you see it in my eyes?
Wanna play in this game of disguise 

It's a masquerade, a love parade
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All though the night and day
My masquerade, I need you baby
So stay with me tonight

Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade

I gotta know the girl behind the mask
Let me in, where you been, don't pretend
Dreamed that I had her alone
Show your face to me, we could be everything

It's a masquerade, a love parade
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All though the night and day
My masquerade, I need you baby
So stay with me tonight

A masquerade, a love parade
So won't you stay and dance with me

Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masqueradeOh
Oh
Oh oh oh yeah
Oh no
Yeah

Shorty ain't got cable,
She ain't even got a radio, way more than able.
What kinda girl should I take her for?
The perfect kind, just what I like,
Exactly what I had in my mind, a dream
She's a dream, yeah

Shorty don't know I'm on the red carpet, almost every night.
And when I'm outta town to go and do work,
I'm first class every flight.
If she takes the time to open her eyes,
She can realize that she's a dream
'Cause she knows me

'Cause Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.
But Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me
That's why I make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah
Make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah

Shorty don't know who I am

And I'm cool with that, if she says so
I ain't even got a lot to her
And when I'm out making pesos?
Ain't' nobody treat her like I do her.
'Cause I'm the one that she thinks about,
The only one on her mind,
She's a dream
'Cause she knows me
And Shorty don't know that I'm on the stage,
Like three or four times a week
She don't even know I've been around the world
And all the different girls I meet.
But there's just one, face that I see
She's the only one for me
She's a dream
'Cause she knows me

'Cuase Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me
That's why I make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah
Make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah
(She's a dream)

See, shorty don't know who I am
That's not good for us, 'cause I know,
It's not good to fuss
And I know she loves me, for me
And I love her, for her
But It wouldn't work if she ever gave
A damn 'bout who I am but she knows me

She don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me
Oh,
Make her say, ah
Make her say, ooh
Make her say, ah

'Bout me
(She's a dream)So empty, can't feel no more,
As I'm left with my tears on the floor
I wait for my heart to mend,
But you keep tearing a hole

Inside, I'm so lost,
In the middle of my heart
It's a battlefield of love,
I've been fighting for too long

And now I'm shattered,
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(But it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

What am I still here for,
Could it be that I'm just waiting
Hoping you'd rescue me,
And put the pieces together again

Inside, I'm so lost,
In the middle of my heart
It's a battlefield of love,
I've been fighting for too long

And now I'm shattered
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(But it slipped from you hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

Tell me what you're really here for,
If you never really loved me
I gave my all but it still wasn't enough

Cause all you had to say was that you ain't
Looking for commitment
Instead of telling me what I wanted to hear, hey

You took my emotions
And scattered them on the ground
So hard to just pick up,
And move on with life, again

And now I'm shattered
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(But it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

Can't believe, you and me, ahhYour words burn, they're melting
What we have, I'm breaking down
No reason, no warning, no love loss
You might as well

Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
Take our memories, throw them all aside
I hope you finally get what you want
Now you know

I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love without ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

I can't feel without ya
You know I can't deal without ya
And now I got a life without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

And this constant echoing
In my head,
I'm spinning 'round
You seem so unaffected
While I go on in this hell

Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
Take our memories, throw them all aside
I hope you finally get what you want
Now you know

I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love without ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

I can't feel without ya
You know I can't deal without ya
And now I got a life without ya
And it's killing me
That we can be undone

We can be undone

You're talking now
And I'm hearin' everything that you say
And I'm holding on is a real phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave
It's dragging me to my grave

You're talking now
And I'm hearin' everything that you say
And I'm holding on is a real phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave

I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love without ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

I can't feel without you, 
You know I can't deal without you
And now I got a life without you, and it's killing me
That we could be undone

I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love with ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

I can't feel without you, 
You know I can't deal without you
And now I got a life without you, and it's killing me
That we could be undoneYou've got me wide open,

Heartbroken, on the floor

I want to say just for the record
That you still got my heart and my soul
You know we're worlds apart, yeah I've got to let you know

You are the piece I can't replace, oh
You left a mark that won't erase, no

No one else can teach me how to love again
'Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it
Nevermind what people say 'cause they don't understand
How you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it

Some try to break through the walls
I've built up but they don't compare to you
One chance, I swear I'll never let you go

You left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling itThe roses you left me slowly fading to grey
Your coat on the chair and the scent of your hair I miss
The clock on the wall it reminds me of all the better times
When we walked in the park and we whispered in the dark
Yeah we laughed and cried

And I never knew alone wherever you are is home

Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe

Ooh I walked by the store where we sat on the floor and we ate like kings
And someone said hey we're locking the door no time to play

And I never knew alone wherever you are is home

Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe

We're not over
We're not over

Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine
And no I can't
You know I can't breathe

Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breatheMadeleine
What's up with those tears in your eyes
What happened when you shut down,
And all the amber lights turned into red
In the silence of your cave, you feel safe
You decorate it with velvet drapes
Outside you see the dark woods
But you don't know there's fields of gold ahead

Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, you'll know
Help is on its way

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise up little girl
'Cause only you can Madeleine

Oh Madeleine

Remember when we used to sit and watch from the bridge
And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what they would find out
You wrote it in a notebook
And said someday that this would be a story to tell
And you'd put it in a movie, maybe be the movie star
Something stole your tears and wiped your smile away

Hold on, don't let go
Hold on and you'll know
Help is on its way

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise up little girl
'Cause only you can Madeleine

Let the sunshine warm your heart today
So rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise up little girl
'Cause only you can Madeleine

Oh Madeleine
Oh MadeleineI've seen it all a thousand times
Falling down I'm still alive, am I? Am I?
So hard to breathe when the water's high
No need to swim I'll learn to fly, so high, so high
You find the truth in a child's eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you

When walls starts to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show 'em what you're made of
When sun light is fading
The world will be waiting for you
Just show 'em what you're made of

Something that you said got into my head
Here I am falling from the edge
Waiting for the day I can run away with you with you
Like angels on fire we burn the sky
One kiss and we say goodbye

If we could only make believe
You and me together
We could be king and queen
Rule another world forever
We'd set our course to live or die
Across the universe
I'd be by your side
If we could only believe
We can only make believe
We could only make believe

Catch another breath I got nothing left
This love I have is pulling me to death
Waiting for the night I can feel alive with you
Like angels on fire we burn the sky
One kiss and we say goodbye

If we could only make believe
You and me together
We could be king and queen
Rule another world forever

Is it too much to ask for
One minute to breath
Cause you take my breath away
Like I'd never sink

You're the reason why cave men drew on the walls
The reason why after every summer we fall

You're the reason I never wanna sleep at night
Cause nothing that I could dream
It's better the you by my side

You know that I love somebody, love somebody

When you wake up with no make up
You try hiding your face,
You know that I, and it's so cute,
You don't even know
How beautiful you are in me

You're the reason why cave men drew on the wall
Why after every summer we fall

And the way the you look in those purple jeans
It's the sexiest thing I ever see

You know that I love somebody, love somebody

It's almost a year since
I got to hold you, head on my shoulder
Dodging the daylight, taking the blame I
It's all I got left, so lately I've spent

Every single night like its 25 to life
And this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven
And I'm guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart
But even I've got rights, you're always gonna be my

Always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
'Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call

First time it rings
I can't help but think of the first time I saw you
That moment I knew
Holding the phone tight, I hear the tone twice
If you just pick up, swear I can fix us

Every single night feels like 25 to life
And this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven
And I'm guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart
But even I've got rights, your always gonna be my

Always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
'Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call

So let me make my case
That way you won't erase the message
That I'm leaving for you now
But if you do at least you knew

'Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call

I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
'Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call

You'll always be my one
You'll always be my one
'Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call
You'll always be my one phone callBeen down the back roads
Where the girls are homegrown
That southern dame's so
Sexy how they talk slow
And something happens in the woods of Kentucky
Drinking moonshine, bon fire, pour the gasoline

Farther south, where the sweet tequila flows
Tiny clothes, Yo te amo, México
Señoritas, we are sippin' margaritas on the beach
They got something you can't teach

I've been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo,
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home

Rock out in Bangkok, where the party, don't stop
Eyes open, blood shot
Seeing things I'd never thought
Sweatin' in the heat
God I love the way they speak
Burning up the streets, dancing like a freak

I've been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo,
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home

So many things to see
So many eyes to meet
I couldn't count them all if I had eternity
So I just want you to know
Everywhere that I go
You take a piece of me

Beijing, Stockholm, Buenos Aires, to tango
Moscow, Cape Town, showed us how to get down
London, Berlin, this is where it all began
San Juan, Sydney, can't forget the NYC

I've been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo,
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like homeWanna be there just in time
Wanna be your shining knight
Protect you like a soldier

I wanna be the first in line
Be the one to save your life
All I wanna do is hold you

But somebody shot you down right in the middle of a war outside
Words mean so little when you've heard those lies
You need someone to make you believe, make you believe...oh oh oh

I will be your soldier
I, I'll stand and fight until it's over
Oh, and if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier

You don't have to hide your scars
I'll be there when you fall apart
And fix you like a soldier

You don't have to go to far
Baby just lay down your arms
Now that the battle's over

But somebody shot you down right in the middle of a war outside
Words mean so little when you've heard those lies
You need someone to make you believe, make you believe, oh oh oh

Did I finally find me a river that could lead me out to the ocean?
'Cause I've only ever known the kind of love 
That leaves you battered and broken
So forgive me for my mixed emotions, yeah yeah

Am I being too open?
'Cause I told you everything I have to say

Does it make you wanna pick up all your things 
And drive away like it's stolen?
Just forgive me if I'm being too open, no no no no, yeah yeah yeah

But now I'm all in 'cause of you
So if you're gonna love me, love me right, yeah

Baby don't goJust memorizing lines upon your face
I made a map, every photo and the details on the frames
And just last night we spilled red wine, how it stained the floor
And though I know that nothing ever really stays the same, no

Oh, if I could stop the hands of that clock
Never let 'em tick, tick, tick
Wherever I go, yeah, I would still know
Even though it's selfish

I don't wanna share you with no one else, no one else
I can't compare you to no one else, no one else
'Cause people change and memories fade
But could you stay the same, if nothing else?
No, I don't wanna share you with no one else, nobody else

Torn by the way your voice is changing on the phone
All this space in between us makes it hard to feel close, close to you
And just last night I had some red wine and it brought me back
No matter what, I'll remember you forever like that? You know

Oh, if I could stop the hands of that clock
Never let 'em tick, tick, tick
Wherever I go, yeah, I would still know
That even though it's selfish, oh

Need to get my hands on all of it all, a-all
I'm passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it all, a-all

Yeah
No, no
I know, know, I'm so passionate, oh
To the beat now, to the beat now

Passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it (la la la la la la la)
Need to get my hands on all of it all, a-all (I'm so passionate, yeah)
I'm passionate 
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it (come on, yeah, yeah)
Need to get my hands on all of it all, a-all (I'm so passionate)Used to heatin' up in the shower, out of her arms
Now you're always in a rush
I could be paranoid but I swear, it's up in the air
Are you fallin' out of love?
The more I think about what we were, the more that I'm sure
Sure, it wasn't what it was, yeah
We used to be, used to be better (used to be better)

We used to talk about growin' old, now I don't know
If we gon' make it through the month
Don't wanna make it real if it's not, I wish I could stop
I'm over overthinking us
Feelin' like it's nowhere to go, it's taking a toll
I don't wanna give you up
But we used to be, used to be better

Is it just me?
Did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me?
Did the night get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing

Is it just, just me? Ooh
Is it just, just me? Ooh

It's two AM, you're not even home, I'm here alone
Callin' but your phone is off
You go and blame it all on your friends, not that again
Need to know what's going on, 'cause
The more I think about how we were, the more that I'm sure
Sure, I'm not the only one, yeah
We used to be, used to be better

Never forget, back when we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one

Is it just me?
Did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me?
Did the night get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing

Is it just, just me? Ooh
Is it just, just me? Ooh

Never forget, back when we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one
Never forget, back when we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one

Is it just me? (Just me, baby)
Did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me? (Just me, baby)
Did the night get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing

Is it just, just me? Ooh
(Is it just me?)
Is it just, just me? Ooh
(I been standin', waitin', gazin' up)
Is it just, just me? Ooh
(You know, you know, you know, I love you)
Is it just, just me? Ooh
(I been waiting for you, baby, yeah, tonight)

Is it just me, is it, is it?
Is it just me, is it, is it?What if I never run into you?
What if you never smiled at me?
What if I had noticed you, too?
And you never showed up where I happened to be

What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
On a quiet night, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
I could have just walked by, who would have thought?

What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?

What if I hadn't asked for your name?
And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me? Oh
Of all of the plans that I could have made
Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh

What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
In a crowded room, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
Getting close to you, but here we are?

What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?

Is it love? Is it fate?
Who am I? Who's to say?
Don't know exactly what it means (ooh, oh, yeah)
Is it love? Is it fate?
Where it leads, who can say?
Maybe you and I were meant to be

What, what
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Two in a million, once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you (my arms around you)
Two in a million (it's like two in a million)
Like once in a life, yeah (whoa)
What are the chances? (What are the chances?)
Two in a million, once in a life
What are the chances? (What are the chances?)
Two in a million, once in a life

What if I never run into you?
And what if you never smiled at me?I've been to Paris, made my way down to Rome
Seen the sun setting on the beach in Mexico
But I could care less, 'cause I was all alone
And there ain't no way to touch your body over the phone

I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you

You're my daybreak, you're my California sun
You're my Memphis, New York, New Orleans all rolled into one
In the city, the country, the mountains or sea
Wherever you are, baby, that's where I wanna be

I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you, no

There ain't no place (no place, no place)
Ooh, yeah, ain't no place
Wherever you are, baby, that's where I wanna be

I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
Said there ain't no place, ain't no place like you, yeah

There ain't no place (no place, no place)
No place
There ain't no place like
No place like you
No place, no place, no place, no place
There ain't no place, no place like youI saw you on the corner
You look happy, happier than I do
Your hair's a little longer
Am I crazy, is it blonder than it was then?
When you walked out of my house
I didn't say a thing, no
It's funny how a year can fill you head with should've, would've, could've been

Took my words, wrote them down, threw them out
And now there's only five left to tell you

Baby, I want you back
There's a space in my bed
In the shape of your head
I said it, what if I said it?
Baby, I want you back
Would you come back around?
'Cause I need you right now
I said it, there, I said it
Baby, I want you back

Would you meet me at the chateau?
At a table, I'd get your favorite chardonnay, yeah
'Cause babe, you know, a bottle is a little bit too much to drink alone
We could catch up, make out, make up
'Cause I don't wanna go
Another day without you, come on

Baby, I want you back
There's a space in my bed
In the shape of your head
I said it, what if I said it?
Baby, I want you back
Would you come back around?
'Cause I need you right now
I said it, there, I said it
Baby, I want you back

Whoa, whoa, at the chateau

Oh, baby, would you meet me at the chateau?
Baby, I want you backYou kiss a little different now
You changed your hair, I like it now
And baby, your body still feels the same (still feels the same)
And soon I'll be lying on the floor
Picking up the pieces
Drinking it away
Pretending I don't need ya
But right now, I'ma hold you like nothing has changed

We'll take it nice and slow
I'll play it for you, just like you like it
Oh, we're two shadows in the dark
Nothing between us but a spark
I'll light this night up, just like you like it

Girl, it's all for you
Everything I do
You just set the groove
I'll pour it on, strong and smooth
We've got all night long
So, tell me what you want
I'm gonna love you just like you like it

Oh, just like you like it

I'll brush that hair back off your face
Girl, let my fingers trace all over you
Just like you like it
You breathe my name, I feel the heat
Now we're on fire in these sheets
'Cause I'm burning for you, just like you like it

Just like you like it, just like you like itJuly
It's only been a month since I met you
I gotta say that was my favorite June
And I knew, from that night
That I would be alright

If I
I only knew that one day I would find
Someone like you, I'd take back all those nights I wasted
Looking for the right one at the wrong door

We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things will happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm ok

Baby, I'm all in it
Just tell me you were on in it
People wanna talk, shut 'em all off
And tell 'em all to mind their business
Will for the grumps and cynics
Been that way from the beginning
People see what they don't have
They get sad and act out 'cause they're winning

Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me too
Ooh, eh, eh

We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things will happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm ok

Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm ok
Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm ok
Nothing else matters
And baby, I know, we'll find a way
Eh, eh, as long as I'm with you, I'm ok
